As Ryan Holiday explains in one of his Daily Dad newsletters, *"at the core of most of the conflict between parents and children—and, of course, spouses—is one thing: judgment. We have opinions and these opinions are the source of disagreement. If we, as dads, would like to have a better relationship with our children, there is just one thing we need to do then: Have fewer of these opinions."*

I think it's a very important message that he sends. Also, he points out that even the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelis wrote in his [*Meditations*](https://amzn.to/2K2gt2L) that we always own the option of having no opinion.

Now think about your job. Think about all those meetings.

Probably you often feel like you must say something, you must share your opinion. Even if you don't have one. You just have to make an opinion. If you're an introvert, then thinking about an opinion is the smaller problemm. You have to express it somehow. And we often fail to do so.

Meetings are usually dominated by people who have opinions just about anything and everything anytime. They already raise their hands or cut someone else's word even before the facilitator finished asking for opinions.

Worse, managers love them. Probably because in their eyes these people justify why their meeting was necessary to happen at the first place. In an ideal world, it could have been a few chat messages between no more than 3 people or maybe it could have been an e-mail. But no. It had to be turned into a meeting so that the same people can share their often unthought opinions wasting the time of at least one whole team.

Well, I might be exagerating. Not every meeting is like that and not every opinion shared in a meeting is garbage.

I think meetings are either ruled by fast thinkers or by people who seemingly don't care if what they speak has little value in it. The reason behind is probably that they know that managers like useless opinions more than no opinions and beause they also think - and often rightly so - that useless, bad or simply unrealistic opinions will lead to a discussion which will lead to better ideas.

In other words, ***the road to great ideas is paved with bad ideas***.

The problem is that this setup is very painful and unfair to introverted people, slow thinkers who like to think before they say something. It's not simply that they have little to no chance to comfortably express themselves, they are even critised for that by their managers. This can easily put them on a downward facing spiral in meetings losing total care and attention.

What are the possible solutions?

Sharing pre-read material early-enough is a simple and good action from facilitators. It will help the interested to prepare for the meeting and maybe even come with ideas. Your slow thinkers will have a chance at least in the beginning of the meeting.

Replace the meeting with something asyncronous. Maybe open a document, an RFC and let the people read it and comment. It requires more work from the facilitator, but it will likely involve more people and generate a higher quality discussion. In addition, you don't have to worry about taking the minutes, the documentation is guaranteed in this case.

If you really want to go with meetings, making them smaller is also a good option. When there are tons of people there, it will be inevitably dominated by a few people. But when there are only a handful of people there, it's likely that there will be only one or two such people leaving more space for the rest and in such a setup everyone is doing their best to listen to everyone, plus the slowthinkers are also making extra efforts becuase they know exactly that they will have to speak no matter what.

Seemingly, we slightly digressed from the original idea of having right not to share your opinion. I would argue it's not the case.

Getting more opinions from more people opens up the right of not having an opinion.

When opinions are asked in a more inclusive way, where even introverts have a better chance to express themselves, it's much easier not to have an opinion.

When it's a hassle to express yourself and often you don't manage to it, you feel that you must have an opinion and you must express that somehow.

On the other hand, when you can express yourself regularly either because it comes naturally to you or because opinions are asked through a framework that fits you, you also gain the right not to have an opinion all the time. What seemed to be a weakness quickly became a strenght. You can share only relevant opinions.
