no ; and it's returned, i don't like that

cout vs println

! calls a macro.
really, we call a macro?

const means different, that's not a problem, it's another language

no type inference for compile tume stuff

slide 20 seems horrible considering the same scope

fn get_bigger_value 'a lifetimes. what??

 immutable can be moved from and destroyed, but it cannot be modified else

 const variables can be initialized later

rust goods and best

nice:
let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
lifetime annotations
macros are with! 
break with return value
break from inner loop with annotated loop


strange:
omit return

no copy and drop at the same time. how is taht?
no viusal cue whether it's a copy or omve?


.. notation to create a new struct. you don't know if it's copied or moved? the fuck man...
