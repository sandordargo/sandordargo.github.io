what is a correct program?

evaluation semantics, 4 different, it's implementation defined. compiler flag! but it can be replaced at runtime
contract assertions can be turned off, so that they don't add runtime overhead

contracts cannot prove that your program is correct, but it can make your code more correct

safety
security
4 definitions of safety\

you can write safe code even without the absence of UB. we've been doing that decades
for security, you might need the absence of UB
it's not sifficient thought

contracts, profiles, they are complementry

P3100 runtmie detection and mitigation of UB across the entire C++ language

keynotes this year are so important and actual

introducing fallback behaviours
there are actually 5 eval semantics
assume! if predicate is not true, undefined.



elena - are you sure about that?

there is a plan and strategy to adress UB

the people stuff is more difficult than the tech part! that is the real problem

UB / Timur
