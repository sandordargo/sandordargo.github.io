In [The Battle Hardened Developer]() by [Fiodar Sazanavets](), the author discusses the concept of echo chambers in the context of the live of a software developer. Echo chambers are both dangerous and useful. In this article, let's review what an echo chamber is, what are the main points of Fiodar on them and then let's see why certain echo chambers should be fostered by your workplace.

## What is an echo chamber?

An echo chamber is an environment where you mostly face the same opinions that you agree with. Or disagree with. Contrary to the common beliefs, an echo chamber is not about whether you agree or disagree with certain ideas. It's simply about facing a narrow range of ideas all the time.

### Are they inherently bad...?

In an echo chamber, you'll lose the points of views of those who think differently. You lose the diversity of aspects.

Social media platforms are quite good in creating echo chambers. You can easily find yourself in a circle where you only hear and read similar very opinions all the time and you are either very happy about it, or you get frustrated and always engage in hostile discussions.

One way or another, the goal of these platforms is to maximize the time you spend on their channels.

It probably seems straightforward that considering always just one side doesn't lead to productive discussions. It doesn't help to understand each other and it actually leads to a very polarized society. A society that we are actually living in and one that can easily further deteriorate.

### ... or is there a good side of echo chambers?

Some people suggest that we should follow content of those who think really differently from us, but Fiodar suggests else. At least partially. We should unfollow people who regularly post opposing opinions in a way that it creates strong emotional responses in us.

Strong emotional responses derail us from our daily routines and therefore they put our career progression at risk. Of course, it's still useful to hear those who think differently... But we should listen to people who express themselves in a way that doesn't provoke those strong reactions.

When we think about echo chambers, we mostly have in mind ones fostered by social media platforms that are related to our religious or political views. But there are many other possible echo chambers. It's worth actively seeking out and creating echo chambers where we keep facing the best practices of our profession.

Such echo chambers can help our personal development. If you find some ideas that you like but it needs discipline to follow them and put them into practice, form echo chambers with those ideas so that you face them all the time and it becomes almost natural to follow them. Think about daily journaling, our Test Driven Development. Probably you find them - often - useful, but you might find it difficult to make the first steps and then to follow up. If you find yourself in an echo chamber surrounding you with the same ideas, you'll make those steps with a much higher chance and you'll identify yourself as a journaling person, or a dev following TDD, etc.

That's one of the reasons why companies also like to create echo chambers.

## Echo chambers as a form of retention? 

I'm not sure if [Fiodar talked about echo chambers at our workplaces](), but it's definitely worth thinking about them. First, think about Meta/Facebok and all those famous posters that are all around its campuses.

Think about the screens where company messages, KPIs, etc. are running all day long. Sometimes at the open offices, sometimes even at the coffee rooms. They are not the only ways for companies to create their own echo chambers for their employees, but definitely an important way.

The messages with company values help keep employees attached like a magnet (though not a very strong one), they are a way to retain people. They foster a feeling of belonging.

The screens with KPIs help the team focus (and game...) certain metrics all the time.

### What is the goal of a consciously created echo chamber?

Simplified, the goal of an echo chamber is to enforce certain messages in order to transform you. As the motivational speaker Jim Rohn said [*"you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with"*](https://www.developgoodhabits.com/five-people/). So you should be picky on chosing the people you spend time with, because they will transofrm you for the better or the worse.

Echo chambers are serving similar purposes. They will define you, transform you for the better or the worse, so you should be picky about them. If not, others will. Companies should also be careful when designing the echo chambers they are creating.

And yes, I think they should be actively creating echo chambers.

I personally hate when companies are defining themselves as your family. 

It's a lie. You might find some friends, you might even marry someone from your workplace, but your colleagues are not your family. People will come and go, management will ditch you in difficult times to protect the company. I hope your family wouldn't leave you behind like that.

Defining your company as your family creates false expectations.

Still, creating a certain a level of belonging is important when it comes with other items of retention policies. I do think that the main motivation to be in a job is to make a good money, but I admit, it's not the only one. There are companies I wouldn't work for because I think they have a negative effect on society and there are some that do more interesting stuff - for me - than others. Some care more about these even than the money they can make. It's important for the comapny to emphasize on these values, as well as on good technical practices they foster.

Employers are not responsible for educating developers - it's the responsibility of the developers to educate themselves - but a good employer should invest in employee education. It's for their own good too.

Creating echo chambers is a good way to promote certain values and practices, such as a culture of learning. It might come from the top by providing and keep communicating on educational opportunities. But it can also come from the bottom if for example individual contributors start organzing a coding dojo or a book club.

## Conclusion

In this article, we talked about echo chambers. In an echo chamber you're surrounded by a narrow set of ideas and values. Usually by ones that you agree with, but not necessarily. You can be surrounded by ideas and valus that you find hostile. It is still an echo chamber.

Although, echo chambers might limit the diversity of ideas you face, it can be still benefitial. First, it's easier to keep focus if you're not constantly dragged into emotional conversations about you disagree with. Second, if you craft your echo chambers well they can enforce your learnings and keep you on track.

For this second reason, creating echo chambers can be desirable also at a workplace to foster some values the company cares about and also to help keeping focus. Probably we have more experience with offline echo chambers at our work places. Next week, let's see how to create them in a remote context.
