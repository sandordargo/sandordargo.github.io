I don't have a formula, I'm just sharing how I dealt with this

- I kept on working
- Trying to help if I can
- Accept that people usually earn their luck, but there are things that are random, that's another kind of luck
- Be an opportunist
  - good time to change things
  - to introduce things you'd like to do
