Reading [The Goal]() was an interesting experience to me. I started to read it as a novel that was very similar to [The Unicorn Project](). No surprise, the former inspired the latter.

The book raised many interesting questions. Some of them it even answered. Some were left for the reader.

And there were the other questsions that were not directly raised, but they probably manifested in many readers.

First and foremost, [The Goal]() discussed what is the goal of a business.

Shouldn't we ask ourselves the same question? What's the goal of an individual?

I've spent some time trying to answer this question.

Now you must be laughing.

Philosphers throughout the history of humanity spent whole lifetimes trying to asnwer this question, yet the question is still open. I not even spent years on it, not to mention a lifetime.

Yet, I'm going to share what I have come up with it. In The Goal, Alex Rogo sovles the issues of his plant by applying the [Theory Of Constraints](). It is based on the premise that the rate of goal achievement is limited by at least one constraint.  If there was nothing preventing a system from achieving higher throughput, its throughput would be infinite â€“ which is impossible in a real-life system.

>>>
Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased.

Assuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements defined, the steps are:

- IDENTIFY the system's constraint(s).
- Decide how to EXPLOIT the system's constraint(s).
- SUBORDINATE everything else to the above decision.
- ELEVATE the system's constraint(s).
- WARNING! If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system's constraint.[4]

The goal of a commercial organization is: "Make more money now and in the future",[5] and its measurements are given by throughput accounting as: throughput, inventory, and operating expenses.

Why is this important for us?

What if we applied the *theory of contraints* to our goals?

## The Personal Goal

Let's start first with the definition of Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt. The goal of a commercial organization is to make money. With the measurements, we can say that the goal is to increase net profit, while simultaneously increasing both Return On Investment (ROI) and cash flow. In the context of a manufacturing plant it means increasing the throughput while decreasing the inventory and operational expenses.

How to translate this into the personal goal?

Can it be the goal of an individual to make as much money as possible?

It obviously can, but it would denigrate human life. We are hopefully more than money-making machines. We have families, we have an impact on our loved ones, on the society, on our environment. Impact seems important part of our goal.

But impact in itself is probably not enough.

Our impact is only about how we change others, but not ourselves.

We can twist words, but when we set goals it's better if they are easy to understand.

Let's introduce growth. Growth is what we need to increase our impact exponentially. Growth is what we need to increase our impact without spending more time on making an impact.

What should be the third pillar of our personal goal besides impact and growth?

I was thinking about *ease* first. But I quickly discarded the idea. *Ease* is not what makes you a great person and not what makes a great life. Similarly I abandonded *comfort* too.

I was considering *time*. So that we could achieve growth and impact in less time. I didn't find it a great idea either. With growth, you can achieve the same or bigger impact in less time. Time is already present in growth's outcome, no need to make it more explicit.

Then I realized what's the ingredient from any meaningful life goal!

Health!

If you're not as healthy as you can reasonably be, it's not worth a damn thing!

No, I don't mean that you should spend 3 hours at the gym every day while you're preparing for your next ultra-marathon while being on this fancy-super-trendy diet eating rainbow dust.

But we should monitor and limit our sugar/alcohol/etc. consumption and we should regularly get up and move. The better health we are in, the more the time we'll have to achieve our goals, the more productive we'll be in the rest of our time.

By investing time and money into your health, you gain future time and even future money as you won't have to spend so much money on drugs and treatments later on. Prevention is king!

## So do we have a goal yet?

The three pillars of our personal goal are:

- Impact
- Growth
- Health

Increase your impact, while you simultaniously grow the necessary skills and improve your health.

So do you know what my goal is now? Do you understand your goal?

Of course, not.

I would rather call it a framework.

I don't see it as a problem.

As Johan said in The Goal, 

> *"The goal is to increase net profit, while simultaneously increasing both ROI and cash flow".*

You have to be aware of what the given business does in order to understand it exactly.

That's the same for personal goals.

You have to understand what you want to have impact on if you want to break it down into actionable items.

The Goal phrased a very vague goal for businesses and a more precise one for manufacturing plants.

Due to the diversity of human interests and preferences, I don't think it's possible to phrase a specific universal goal for individuals, but following the logic of The Goal, it seems possible to give a framework that help folks to define and follow up on his goal.

Let me give you a possible one. Let's say my goal is to help engineers grow and devlier better solutions.

Then following the previously defined framework (*Increase your impact, while you simultaniously grow the necessary skills and improve your health.*), let's see what we can come up.

Increase the 








## What does this framework reveal?

While I wrote that focusing on money is probably a bit inhumane. Still, at the end of the day, you pay for your groceries, for your flat, for petrol, for your internet with the good old money.

Our individual grwoth framework is panfully neglecting the financial aspects.

Is that a problem?

If my personal goal is to make sure that Hungarian children who were and will be born in the surrounding countries can have access to Hungarian education then what the hell am I doing at my current job writing software? What am I doing outside of my working hours on this blog?

Am I living in a cognitive dissonance?

My framework is definitely good for highlighting the problem. But can it give an answer?

What are the possible answers anyway?

- I am not living according to my goals
- My framework is faulty
- My framework should be considered only for my life outside my job

Let's have a look at them.

### I am not living according to my goals

That's a valid fear. A possible reason for that is that I don'


 Or I just have many contradicting ones.
The 3 goals of a person. Family, work, otherwise...

So we have to answer them separately, though health is a common factor between them.

### My framework is faulty

It's definitely not perfect and could be better.

But our life is complex too, can we expect something to cover it all.
We need that a framework covers a given part of it.


### My framework should be considered only for my life outside my job

Goes in the same diretion as the previous ones.
Still, if your work goals are so different than your outside job goals, is there a problem?

If your goal is to lie down on the sofa and play PS5 all day long, then of course there is no problem... You can't realistically expect to make money out of it, though think about e-sports and twitch.

Otherwise, what can be the possibilities?

We live in the slavery of money and work. We just want to earn more to keep up with some unrealistic expectations. Just to make someone else happy.

Or we choose a profession that we don't despise and think about it as a business. Me inc. The goal is to make money. Essentially, we want to make money

*"The goal is to increase net profit, while simultaneously increasing both ROI and cash flow".*
*"The goal is to increase the throughput while you decrease the inventory and the operational expenses."*

The goal is to increase net income, while increasing our hourly rate and decreasing the time spent on working.

The goal is to increase your impact, while you simultaniously grow your needed skills and improve your health.



And then we take another for 

the goal
-> make money
  do this while while
  3 measurements

that's all nice but what can be our goal as an individual

make money?
no, think about all those jerks, who make money but have no families, not even real impact...

we ften say growth, 
but growth is not enough, if you don't use your knowledge it's worth nothing
so impact, but again it's not enough

maybe growht + impact

what should be the third, reqard is lousy, maybe efficiency?
efficiency cannot really be a goal
- ease? no...
- comfort...
- personal benefits..
- in less time, but time is sent back to these shit...
- health! while keeping your health! can it be part of impact? you cannot make an impact without health... can you?



The goal simplifies the goal of a company to make money. These days it seems not trough, they want to change societies, they want to change  values. But do they? Are they just riding the waves to make more money? Probably they do. And in any case, societies should not deal with values we live by. It shouldn't be a money question, it's fishy.

But if the goal of a company can be phrased so simply?

Can it be done for the individual?

Heck, pholosphers were trying to do it for years.

My best answer is that to goal is to live a meaningful life.

Now let's define the pillars that gives us that meaning.


impact on who??/


growth + impact + haelth

you need to grow to have a bigger impacet
You need impact to make grow meangingful, not just l'art pour l'art
Youneed heatlh for the previous two

find my own growth and impact areas
