[We talked about echo chambers recently.]() Echo chambers are bubbles where the same ideas, the same values surround you. Usually ones you agree with, but not necessarily. We often associate echochambers with its negative effects, but echochambers can be useful as well. They are convenient to strengthen the effects of positive ideas in you. Echochambers can be accidental or they can be crafted. I think it's useful for you to create an echochamber around yourself to instill some best practices, some positive thoughts in you.

We mentioned that companies like to create echo chambers in order to increase the attachment of employers to the company. They keep shooting at you the same messages everywhere. THey put of posters with the company values in the toilet, there are screens at the coffee rooms with similar messages and often screens constantly showing some KPIs in the open offices.

This is obviously chaning with the remote world. But can companies still create echo chambers for their employers? And if so, what are the different forms?

Those are the main questions of this article.

## Is it possible for companies to create strong echo chambers in a remote world?

My gut answer is yes, of course. After all, most often we talk about echo chambers in relation with social media platforms which are inherently virtual. Facebook or Twitter often create very strong echo chambers around us in the virtual world. So it is possible. At the same time, it's not that simple for employers. Why is so?

The goal of social media platforms is to maximize the time you spend on them. They deisgn everything around that goal. The more time you spend there, the more ads you will look at, the more interactions you make the more money they will make.

You use social media to stimulate your brain. To get some free endorphines, also to connect with friends. But above all, you use social media to procrastinate, to avoid real-world activities... such as work.

At work, your employer obviously doesn't want you and your colleagues to avoid work and to procrastinate, but they want us to focus on our tasks and deliver value to the customers. Who could blame them?!

If an employer's internal social media is too good, people will spend too much time scrolling it, commenting on it. They will keep thinking about what to post if they are afraid that their visibiliaty is a too important part of their evaluation. Sadly, it's often a valid fear. At the same time, if the internal platform is not good enoigh, if it doesn't help delivering the key messages, it might be useless.


## Two approaches

### Top down

Use social media
  - previously mentioned problem
  - you'll be locked in with a provider?
  - only at big places it is meaningful

Use newsletters
  - who looks at emails?
  - links to other platforms where you can still post comments
  - more work to edit
  - what if too many or too few posts

What if each meetins would have a mandatory topic?
  - would people ironize?
  - still it would send a message...
  - if there are some investments

Instead of the screen -> keep bringing it up at the daily, have a link pinned to the channel, have a script for the dail where that is part 

### What about bottom up?
  - slack channels
  - virtual handsons
  - just keep bringing it up
  - it's not that different...







After all, it's probably not the channel that matters that much. What really matters is that you feel that people really mean it.














Let's say that your comapny wants to have a culture where people strongly care about quality. Let's put aside that [quality is something really hard to define](https://devreads.sandordargo.com/zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-by-robert-pirsig/). But at least it's often easy to notice when quality is neglected. In such circumstances, don't expect to create an echo chamber. But when you feel that people do care, even if sometimes they make jokes about the strong efforts, it will really sink in.

I used to work for an American oil company. That's a dangerous business. Not for the IT workers for sure, but safety is equally important for everyone. There were many safety related events. Besides those dedicated meetings, each and every meeting had to start with safety minutes. We reviewed where and how to leave in case of emergency, plus someone had to share something that was somehow related to safety.

Yes. Sometimes it's dull. Sometimes people made fun of it. A lot... Me too... But we understood that they did care, they spent a lot of money promoting safety and they tried to make it relevant even in an office context. I still think that having mirrors on the ceiling at the corners was a good idea and did prevent sometimes people bumping into each other.

It did sink in and I still approach activities with the safery mindset think about what can go wrong and how could I avoid it. How I caould have avoided an accident. 

Let's say that this American oil major was succesful in creating an echo chamber.

What did they do?

- They chose a topic that was important for them.
- They made it relevant for the employees by tailoring what safety meant in different contexts.
- They made the employees invested by the various reward programs and by lifting the idea into performance reviews
- After all, they invested money into the idea and they did care

## How could they do the same in a remote context?

## How to create a quality echo chamber?

(Make it more concreate than quality)

As I mentioned, quality is somthing that is hard ot grasp. Let's be a bit more specific. I'm a big fan of Sandro Mancuso's book [the software craftsmanship]() and we tried to establish the related best practices in our teams. Pair programming, TDD, timeboxing, clean code, whatever.

Speaking a lot about these practices, making presentations (not by managers) is important and useful. It's good to catch attention of the people. But don't expect that they will take their time to learn and practice. There are some people who are so immersed in their profession that they dedicate their own free time to hone their skills. But that's not the norm and even if you're a person like that, you cannot expect it from others to do similarly.

So if you want to create an echo chamber that leads to change, you have to provide the people the opportunity to practice. And it's better than in a social setting. By social I don't mean that you should physically meet, remote is also fine. There are tools to conduct good remote pair programming sessions. We use VS Code Live share and it works pretty weel. It improved a lot during the last year in terms of reliability.

Dissect it into
what are echochamnbers and how can be useful for companies
remote echo chambers and its dangers
or
echo chambers IÃ¡ve seen at work and how they should work in a remote context

if a company can create such chambers when they are remote first.



With remote work, such echo chambers are losing from their power. Or... are they? Can companies create similarly strong echo chambers when they are fully or partly remote? Should they in the first place? What's the goal of such echo chambers?

This last question is the origo of our quest.
