Why do we work?

This might seem to be an easy question at first. But then you soon realise that there are very different ways to approach and answer this question.

## Because I have to!

The most intuitive answer might be "because I have to!" After all there are bills to pay and food to buy. You might have other fixed costs, but that's a bare minimum unless you grow your own food. But that's hard labour as well. In brief, we can say that you work in order not to freeze and starve to death.

But if you give a deep thought to the question, there might be something else as well. 

## To be who I am

After all, most of use have probably seen aging people not stopping to work. Or people whose life and health started to collapse when they retired. They lost a part of their identity, a part of their life...

Our work give us a part of our identity either we like that or not. In simplistic terms, what you work is what you are. This is not a surprising metaphor. They say that you're the combination of the 5 people you spend your time with. They also say that you are what you eat. I say that you're what you do day to day.

You develop software? You're a software developer.

You drive a lorry? You're a lorry driver.

For most people, this identity, the way they spend their time at work bring more things to their lives. Often, your friends will be of the same profession, they will share similar interests, they might even eat similarly. There is a fair chance that what your work bring you a whole lifestyle.

But not all software engineers are the same! And I'm not thinking about the programming languages or the frameworks we use. We have different traits. We are not software engineers. We are more than that. Or maybe less. Maybe you're a complainer and most of your friends are complainers and you spend a big amount of time complaining, creating probleds where there is none instead of just do your work the best you can and enjoy your life. I bet that if you tend to complain a lot, most people around you also do the same.

But maybe you're a problem solver and you are irritated by being surrounded by complainers. So you encircle yourself with problem solvers and you complain much less than others. You are a positive person who makes existing problems go away.

In any case, our work and how we work is part of our identity probably more than we think.

But we are not passive passengers in our careers, at least we should not be. We can and should form both our work and therefore who we are.

At that point, we would drop an important part of our identity and without thorough preparation we couldn't deal with it psychologically. It would require a lot of time and planning to make that move, but it's certianly possible.

> But I'm not there yet, I'm certainly not wanting to write about that. Maybe one day, I will.

## Do what you want to be

If work is part of our identity we should not simply go with the flow at whatever corporation. Ignore for a moment the rightful mantra that you should drive your career. I say something else. If you don't enjoy your work, if you are not happy with what you do, it will be bloody difficult to be happy outside work. It is certainly possible, but it will consume way too much of your energy! Energy that you could use better if you enjoyed what you do in the first place.

Team goals, deadlines and business priorities are of course important. You're paid to do a job. But most of us will be much more effective if we are happy with what we do and with how we do it. So if you don't like your job, try to alter it. Bring in some elements you enjoy, try out different responsibilities in the team, maybe some extracurricular activities. In bigger companies, you'll find many of those and usually they are both well seen by management and needed to get a promotion. If nothing helps, figure out what you really want and apply for a position that you think would help you.

Recently, I've seen several people who was revitalized by a change or who kept alive their fire by adding some extra elements to their work. Just don't let boredom, complaining and eventually hatred take over. It won't only infect your work life and maybe not even only your life.

## Conclusion

Maybe you think that you work only to survive and pay your bills and maybe to save some money, but given how big part of our life we spend working, it has a much bigger effect on you. Probably the easiest way to obseve those effects is my paying attention to older people around their retirement. Our work is part of our identity. Not only what we do but also how we do it. Therefore it's very important to make sure that we happy with what we do and how we do it. It has profound effects on our lives.

Make sure that you find joy in your job. If you don't change your job. If you cannot, change jobs.

 We must be an active part of it, you must be navigating through it having yourself at the steering wheel. You have avoid at all costs to do for a longer period of time something that you don't like something you cannot identify with because it will eat you up. Though in certain situations you might decide to be eaten up and give yourself to what you were given to. In a certain way that was my case as well. As someone told me, I didn't choose C++, C++ chose me. This doesn't mean that I know C++ better than you. This refers to the fact that about 10 years ago I made a move in my career to avoid working with C++, but that was not how it turned out in that team and I had to make a decisiion. I had to choose between suffering and learning C++ much better that my level was. I went with the letter. So I still took an active part of my life, I still made a decision and a good one. I could have decided to leave as well, but it was out of question.

So if you're in a situation you don't like, you have to make up your mind. Is it because it clearly doesn't fit your interests and personality and probably your career aspirations or simply because it's due ot a lack of knowledge.

How to recognize if it's one or the other? I don't nkow. If you're in the beginning of your career, it's probably aboutn the lack of knowledge and you have to clearly immerse yourself in a role, in a technology, maybe several ones. If you're a more season professional, you probably know more.

What I want to say is that be active part of your career, because you don't only work to make money, you do it to sculpt yourself, to improve yourself and what you do should be part of it. You might say that it's not true, but you spend probably at least 40 hours a week working. That about a quarter of your time and if we discount the time you sleep, let's say another 40 hours a week (let's hope it's more), then it's already a third of your time being awake. You should spend it wisely.
