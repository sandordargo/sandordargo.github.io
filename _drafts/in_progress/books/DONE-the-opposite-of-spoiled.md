As a parent of young children, I'm obviously interested in how to raise awareness about money. My daughter is seven years old and would want to buy just anything and everything. I'm not worried about it, I think her behaviour is normal, but I also think that it's our job to give her the right tools, the right mindset.

I'm a relatively frugal person and I never had problems of spending more than I had. I know that my grandparnets and also my parents had a big role in this. My mother was really frugal because we didn't have a lot. At the same time, every few years we could go abroad on vacation for a week. I remember we always brought most of our own food. We also had quite decent appliances at home because they always saved up for ones with a good energy consumption level. I have memories discussing this at home, I remember her calculating budgets.

But she is not around, I cannot ask her any questions and in any case, my situation is different than hers was. While looking for a good book on this, I ran into The Opposite of Spoiled by Ron Lieber.

I don't know yet if I agree with everything Ron Lieber wrote, but in general I like the ideas presented. I can identify with many of the problems explained. Let me share with you a couple of interesting ideas from the book.

## Why early education is so important?

The author claims that we should start early the financial education of our children. One of his points might be specific to certain countries, but he is still right. Around the age of 17-18, our children have to take a decision. They decide whether they want to pursue higher education, they have to pick college or university they want to go to.

While for some this is not a financial decision, usually it is at least partly a monetary compromise. Maybe the parents are rich, maybe the education is free, maybe not. One way ar another this decision has its fiscal aspects. Maybe because of the money the parents will pay that they saved up during decades, maybe because of the student loans going to be taken or maybe "only" because of the salary one can expect after graduation.

In any case, we talk about a decision that has a huge and long-term impact on our lives. And the decision is to be taken by a 17 year old who never bought something more expesive than a bike. That's what you call lunacy.

To avoid or at least improve such situations, kids should start learning and experimenting with money early on.

## The three jars of money

Once you decided that you should educate your kids early, the most important questions are *how early* and *how*?

According to the author, you should start as early as they can count a few bucks. You should start the education by giving them a weekly allowance that they are responsible of.

But making them responsible does not mean free for all just as like a free democracy doesn't mean that everyone can do anything without rules. That's chaos and anarchy. You want them to learn by rules and examples and still leaving them some space for free experimentation.

The author introduced three transparent jars for each kid at home and whenever the allowance is coming they divide the sum between the three jars, each representing one of the following three areas:
- throwaway money
- long-term savings
- charity

First of all, the jars are transparent so that you can have a quick glance on them and understand how much money more-or-less they contain.

Thow-away money means that kids ideally should have some money that they can spend on whatever they'd like wherever and whenever. That helps them both to learn to use money, to feel how easily it can go away and what kind of joy it cen help you get.

Long-term savings is obviously for a bigger purpose and though the purpose should not be set by the parents, we should help our kids setting it. Accumulating money in the long-term savings jar is often incentivized by parents by paying interests on the contents of this jar.

The charity jar is also important as kids should learn and understand early on that there is always someone who is in a bigger need than they are and we should help them within our means. This helps them become responsible citizens and it also helps fostering interesting discussions around money. Such as where as a family we should donate some of our money and why. If the family has a donation budget, children can take their parts of the decisions.

## Patience and perseverence

Having an allowance (or salary...) is also about patience. How patiently we can defer our joy for a greater good? While allowance is about patience, when money comes in excahnge for work it's only about patience, but also about perseverence. You have to keep working to get what you want. So it's also good if they have the chance to work for some of their money.

Not saying that they should get money for basic house chores, because they should take their fair responsibility of running a household. But if there are some works that you'd pay for for someone else, you might just pay them.

But no matter how much they get, no matter how many stuff you provide them, make sure you don't spoil them. Sure, there will be others in their environments who get more, get nicer and get it faster. But they should also learn how to wait. According to author, kids should be in the top 70% when it comes to things such as getting a car, gettint a phone, etc. In toher words, 6 out of 10 kids should get things faster than them and only a faw slower. As such, they will learn to wait for some of the things.

It might be that they get something among the first ones, but then next time they should be among the last ones. For sure, they will be a little impatient, a little jelous, but they won't get feel utterly deprived.

Apart from patience they will also learn that most things are useless. Quite often, the first movers realize that what they got is useless by the time the 4th-5th kid would get theirs.

## Conclusion

Teaching your children awareness of money is a difficult task. The Opposite of Spoiled by Ron Lieber will give you some ideas how to start. Let them learn wait, teach them to save for a long term goal and also to be generous are important, but they are not the only tasks and the techinques I shared are in this article not the only ones proposed.

If you are a parent and if you are concenrned about your kids' financial education The Opposite of Spoiled is a reocmmended read.
