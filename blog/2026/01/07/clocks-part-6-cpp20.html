Those clocks — system_clock, steady_clock, and high_resolution_clock — all arrived in C++11, the first standard shipping the &lt;chrono&gt; library. C++20 expanded the picture quite a bit by introducing five additional clocks. Let’s briefly explore them today. Why More Clocks? If you’ve only used system_clock and steady_clock so far, the newer clocks may feel obscure. Do you really need a UTC clock? Or a TAI one? Isn’t a timestamp just a timestamp? Unfortunately… no. The world runs on multiple time scales, and the mapping between them isn’t fixed. Leap seconds, epoch differences, and OS-specific behavior often complicate what seems like a simple task: “what time is it?” C++20 exposes these time scales explicitly so you can choose the right one — and avoid silently mixing incompatible concepts. std::chrono::utc_clock: The Leap-Second-Aware Clock utc_clock is C++20’s answer to “give me real-world wall-clock time, including leap seconds.” It explicitly models leap seconds, meaning conversions can fail or yield non-linear results if a timestamp lands inside a leap-second insertion. C++20 also introduced std::chrono::leap_second and related utilities. You cannot construct a leap second manually — the implementation provides these objects based through the time zone database. They allow the program to reason about known leap-second insertions. utc_clock helps with logging and tracing when timestamps must align with real-world UTC or when you have to interact with external systems using leap seconds. std::chrono::tai_clock: International Atomic Time (TAI) TAI comes from the French Temps Atomique International. TAI is an abbreviation of the French name: Temps Atomique International. It has an earlier epoch than other clocks, measuring time since 00:00:00, 1 January 1958. TAI does not include leap seconds. This means: It runs uniformly. UTC gradually falls behind it. The UTC–TAI offset grows whenever a leap second is inserted into UTC. At its birth, TAI was 10 seconds ahead of UTC. Today that offset is 37 seconds — and will keep increasing. tai_clock meets the Clock requirements. It does not meet the TrivialClock requirements unless the implementation can guarantee that now() does not throw an exception. Use it for scientific computing, simulation and satellite calculations or anytime leap-second-free arithmetic is needed. It’s also useful as a reference scale for custom clocks if you want stable arithmetics and interoperability with civil time. std::chrono::gps_clock: Time for Satellites As you probably guessed, gps_clock represents Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Its epoch is 6th January 1980, and it has no leap seconds. Therefore, just like tai_clock, gps_clock drifts from utc_clock as new leap seconds are added. Since 2018, the difference between utc_clock and gps_clock is 18 seconds. The constant difference between gps_clock and tai_clock is 19 seconds (GPS is behind TAI), Like tai_clock, gps_clock satisfies the Clock requirements, but it’s short of TrivialClock with a non-throwing now() implementation. It is indispensable for navigation, mapping, telemetry, and systems consuming GNSS timestamps. std::chrono::file_clock: A Practical Clock for Filesystem Timestamps file_clock is the clock underlying std::filesystem::file_time_type. Its epoch is implementation-defined — different operating systems store file times differently — but it must satisfy the TrivialClock requirements. Before C++20, conversions between file timestamps and system_clock were also implementation-defined, which made round trips lossy or surprising. C++20 fixed that: file_clock models exactly the timestamp format used by the filesystem. Conversions to system_clock or utc_clock must be well-defined. Round-tripping file times becomes predictable. It’s not intended for scheduling or measurement — it’s purely for interoperability with the filesystem. std::chrono::locat_t: Civil Time Without a Time Zone C++20 also introduced a pseudo-clock named local_t, used to indicate that a time_point represents local civil time, but without a specified time zone. 1 auto local = std::chrono::local_time&lt;std::chrono::minutes&gt;{ ... }; A local_time only becomes meaningful when paired with a time zone: 1 2 auto tz = std::chrono::locate_zone(&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;); auto sys_time = tz-&gt;to_sys(local); This design forces you to handle time-zone rules, DST transitions, and ambiguities explicitly. Conclusion The additional clocks introduced in C++20 expand &lt;chrono&gt; with an expressive model of real-world time. They let you choose the right time scale for your needs — whether you care about leap seconds, scientific precision, satellite signals, filesystem compatibility, or human-readable local time. In future articles, we’ll look at how these clocks interact with time zones, calendars, and custom clock designs — and how to test all of these reliably.

Or a TAI one? Isn’t a timestamp just a timestamp?</p><p>Unfortunately… no.</p><p>The world runs on <strong>multiple time scales</strong>, and the mapping between them isn’t fixed. Leap seconds, epoch differences, and OS-specific behavior often complicate what seems like a simple task: <em>“what time is it?”</em></p><p>C++20 exposes these time scales explicitly so you can choose the right one — and avoid silently mixing incompatible concepts.</p><h2 id="stdchronoutc_clock-the-leap-second-aware-clock"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::utc_clock</code>: The Leap-Second-Aware Clock</h2><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utc_clock</code> is C++20’s answer to <em>“give me real-world wall-clock time, including leap seconds.”</em></p><p>It explicitly models leap seconds, meaning conversions can fail or yield non-linear results if a timestamp lands inside a leap-second insertion.</p><p>C++20 also introduced <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::leap_second</code> and related utilities. You cannot construct a leap second manually — the implementation provides these objects based through the time zone database. They allow the program to reason about known leap-second insertions.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utc_clock</code> helps with logging and tracing when timestamps must align with real-world UTC or when you have to interact with external systems using leap seconds.</p><h2 id="stdchronotai_clock-international-atomic-time-tai"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::tai_clock</code>: International Atomic Time (TAI)</h2><p>TAI comes from the French <em>Temps Atomique International</em>. TAI is an abbreviation of the French name: <em>Temps Atomique International</em>. It has an earlier epoch than other clocks, measuring time since <strong>00:00:00, 1 January 1958</strong>.</p><p>TAI does <strong>not</strong> include leap seconds.<br /> This means:</p><ul><li>It runs uniformly.<li>UTC gradually falls behind it.<li>The UTC–TAI offset grows whenever a leap second is inserted into UTC.</ul><p>At its birth, TAI was 10 seconds ahead of UTC. Today that offset is 37 seconds — and will keep increasing.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tai_clock</code> meets the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Clock</code> requirements. It does not meet the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrivialClock</code> requirements unless the implementation can guarantee that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">now()</code> does not throw an exception.</p><p>Use it for scientific computing, simulation and satellite calculations or anytime leap-second-free arithmetic is needed. It’s also useful as a reference scale for custom clocks if you want stable arithmetics and interoperability with civil time.</p><h2 id="stdchronogps_clock-time-for-satellites"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::gps_clock</code>: Time for Satellites</h2><p>As you probably guessed, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gps_clock</code> represents <strong>Global Positioning System (GPS) time</strong>.</p><p>Its epoch is 6th January 1980, and it has no leap seconds. Therefore, just like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tai_clock</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gps_clock</code> drifts from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utc_clock</code> as new leap seconds are added. Since 2018, the difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utc_clock</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gps_clock</code> is 18 seconds. The constant difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gps_clock</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tai_clock</code> is 19 seconds (GPS is behind TAI),</p><p>Like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tai_clock</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gps_clock</code> satisfies the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Clock</code> requirements, but it’s short of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrivialClock</code> with a non-throwing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">now()</code> implementation.</p><p>It is indispensable for navigation, mapping, telemetry, and systems consuming GNSS timestamps.</p><h2 id="stdchronofile_clock-a-practical-clock-for-filesystem-timestamps"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::file_clock</code>: A Practical Clock for Filesystem Timestamps</h2><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_clock</code> is the clock underlying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::filesystem::file_time_type</code>.</p><p>Its epoch is implementation-defined — different operating systems store file times differently — but it <strong>must</strong> satisfy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrivialClock</code> requirements.</p><p>Before C++20, conversions between file timestamps and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system_clock</code> were also implementation-defined, which made round trips lossy or surprising.</p><p>C++20 fixed that:</p><ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_clock</code> models exactly the timestamp format used by the filesystem.<li>Conversions to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system_clock</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utc_clock</code> must be <strong>well-defined</strong>.<li>Round-tripping file times becomes predictable.</ul><p>It’s not intended for scheduling or measurement — it’s purely for <strong>interoperability</strong> with the filesystem.</p><h2 id="stdchronolocat_t-civil-time-without-a-time-zone"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::locat_t</code>: Civil Time Without a Time Zone</h2><p>C++20 also introduced a pseudo-clock named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_t</code>, used to indicate that a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">time_point</code> represents <strong>local civil time</strong>, but without a specified time zone.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
