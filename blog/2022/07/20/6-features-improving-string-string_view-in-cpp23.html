Thanks to P2166R1, this is not something to worry about. Instead of undefined behaviour, the constructor and assignment operator overloaded with nullptr_t are deleted and therefore compilation fails when you attempt to construct a new string out of a nullptr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 std::string s(nullptr); /* &lt;source&gt;:18:26: error: use of deleted function &#39;std::__cxx11::basic_string&lt;_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc&gt;::basic_string(std::nullptr_t) [with _CharT = char; _Traits = std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;; _Alloc = std::allocator&lt;char&gt;; std::nullptr_t = std::nullptr_t]&#39; 18 | std::string s(nullptr); | ^ /opt/compiler-explorer/gcc-12.1.0/include/c++/12.1.0/bits/basic_string.h:734:7: note: declared here 734 | basic_string(nullptr_t) = delete; | ^~~~~~~~~~~~ */ While this change is good and points in a good direction, not all of our problems disappear with nullptrs. Taking a nullptr and a size in the constructor (e.g. std::string s(nullptr, 3)) is still valid and remains undefined behaviour. These changes are also valid for string_view. Build std::string_view from ranges With C++23, our favourite string_view doesn’t only loses a constructor (the overload with a nullptr gets deleted), but also receives a new one. Soon, we’ll be able to construct one out of a range directly. So far, if we wanted to create a string_view out of a “range”, we had to invoke the constructor with a begin and and end iterators: std::string_view sv(myRange.begin(), myRange.end());. Now we’ll be able to directly construct a string_view based on a range: std::string_view sv(myRange);. basic_string::resize_and_overwrite() One of the main reasons to use C++ is its high performance. An area where we often use the language in a non-efficient way is string handling. C++23 will bring us another string member function that will help us to handle strings in a more performant way. std::string::resize_and_overwrite() takes two parameters, a count and an operation and does the following (while returns nothing): if the count is smaller or equal to the size() ofthe string, it erases the last size() - count elements if count is larger than size(), appends n - size() default-initialized elements it also invokes erase(begin() + op(data(), count), end()). In other words, resize_and_overwrite() will make sure that the given string has continuous storage containing count + 1 characters. If op() throws, the behaviour is undefined. It’s also undefined if it tries to modify count. But what can be an operation? An operation is a function or function object to set the new contents of the string and it takes two parameters. The first one is the pointer to the first character in the string’s storage and the second one is the same as count, the maximal possible new size of the string. It should return the actual new length of the string. You have to pay attention that this operation doesn’t modify the maximum size, does not try to set a longer string and doesn’t modify the address of the first character either. That would mean undefined behaviour. If correctly used, it’ll help add some new content or rewrite the existing one. Or you can actually remove content. To illustrate this latter example, let’s have a look at the second example of the original documentation. 1 2 3 4 5 6 std::string s { &quot;Food: &quot; }; s.resize_and_overwrite(10, [](char* buf, int n) { return std::find(buf, buf + n, &#39;:&#39;) - buf; }); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;2. &quot; &lt;&lt; std::quoted(s) &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; // 2. &quot;Food&quot; Even though s is resized to 10, the operation will return the position of : in the string meaning that it will be truncated from that point.

Starting from C++23 they must satisfy the TriviallyCopyable concepts. As both of these objects already have default copy assignment operators and constructs and also destructors and besides they only expose a size_t and a raw pointer, it is implied that these types can be trivially copyable and in fact, the major compilers already implemented them as so. Ensuring this trait for the future makes sure developers can continue depending on these characteristics and less courageous developers can start using them as such for example in heterogeneous computing. : string-stream with std::span-based buffer C++23 is introducing the &lt;spanstream&gt; header. Streams are an old part of the C++ standard library. Nowadays stringtreams are widely used. Strings (and vectors) store data outside of themselves. When the data to be stored grows, the storage and the already stored data might be automatically and dynamically reallocated. This is often acceptable, but when it’s not, we need another option. &lt;spanstream&gt; is going to provide such an option, they provide fixed buffers. You have to take care of the allocation when you create your stream, but you don’t have to worry about the costly reallocation of the underlying buffer once it’s exhausted.

In practice, this might happen when you convert a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const char *</code> to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code>. What happens then? It depends on the compiler, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> for example, throws a runtime exception.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2166r1.html">P2166R1</a>, this is not something to worry about.</p><p>Instead of undefined behaviour, the constructor and assignment operator overloaded with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullptr_t</code> are deleted and therefore compilation fails when you attempt to construct a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code> out of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code>.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>While this change is good and points in a good direction, not all of our problems disappear with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code>s. Taking a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code> and a size in the constructor (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string s(nullptr, 3)</code>) is still valid and remains undefined behaviour.</p><p>These changes are also valid for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string_view</code>.</p><h2 id="build-stdstring_view-from-ranges">Build <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string_view</code> from ranges</h2><p>With C++23, our favourite <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string_view</code> doesn’t only loses a constructor (the overload with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code> gets deleted), but also receives a new one. Soon, we’ll be able to construct one out of a range directly.</p><p>So far, if we wanted to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string_view</code> out of a <em>“range”</em>, we had to invoke the constructor with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">begin</code> and and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end</code> iterators: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string_view sv(myRange.begin(), myRange.end());</code>. Now we’ll be able to directly construct a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string_view</code> based on a range: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string_view sv(myRange);</code>.</p><h2 id="basic_stringresize_and_overwrite"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_string::resize_and_overwrite()</code></h2><p>One of the main reasons to use C++ is its high performance. An area where we often use the language in a non-efficient way is string handling. <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1072r10.html">C++23 will bring us another <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code> member function</a> that will help us to handle strings in a more performant way.</p><p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/resize_and_overwrite"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string::resize_and_overwrite()</code></a> takes two parameters, a count and an operation and does the following (while returns nothing):</p><ul><li>if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> is smaller or equal to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size()</code> ofthe string, it erases the last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size() - count</code> elements<li>if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> is larger than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size()</code>, appends <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n - size()</code> default-initialized elements<li>it also invokes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erase(begin() + op(data(), count), end())</code>.</ul><p>In other words, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resize_and_overwrite()</code> will make sure that the given string has continuous storage containing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count + 1</code> characters.</p><p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">op()</code> throws, the behaviour is undefined. It’s also undefined if it tries to modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code>.</p><p>But what can be an operation?</p><p>An operation is a function or function object to set the new contents of the string and it takes two parameters. The first one is the pointer to the first character in the string’s storage and the second one is the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code>, the maximal possible new size of the string. It should return the actual new length of the string.</p><p>You have to pay attention that this operation doesn’t modify the maximum size, does not try to set a longer string and doesn’t modify the address of the first character either. That would mean undefined behaviour.</p><p>If correctly used, it’ll help add some new content or rewrite the existing one. Or you can actually remove content. To illustrate this latter example, let’s have a look at the second example of the original documentation.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

Streams are an old part of the C++ standard library. Nowadays <em>stringtreams</em> are widely used. Strings (and vectors) store data <em>outside</em> of themselves. When the data to be stored grows, the storage and the already stored data might be automatically and dynamically reallocated. This is often acceptable, but when it’s not, we need another option.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;spanstream&gt;</code> is going to provide such an option, they provide fixed buffers. You have to take care of the allocation when you create your stream, but you don’t have to worry about the costly reallocation of the underlying buffer once it’s exhausted. When I wrote that you have to take care of the bugger allocation, I really meant it. The buffer is not owned by the stream object, its life has to be managed by the programmer.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope you enjoyed this article and you also got excited by all these various <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string_view</code> related features that C++23 is going to bring us.
