Combine them and you get a very C++ centric idiom. I already used it our code base since to refactor a big piece of code and remove some hundreds of copied lines. The basic idea behind is that the public API of your classes only provide a non-virtual interface, keeping it fairly simple. No need to think about what implementation is called in the end.
