We won’t only discuss the motivations behind the proposal introducing this header (P0448R4), but we’ll check out an older proposal also from Peter Sommerlad (P0408R7) which modified std::basic_stringbuf back in C++20. The reason for covering both is that the author aims for the same purpose with the two proposals. One completes the other. strstreams are dead, long live the buffers and spans! While streams are one of the oldest parts of the C++ standard library they haven’t been keeping up with the winds of change since the release of C++11 and they required some updates. The motivation behind these two proposals is to have a stream that avoids unnecessary copies of buffers. In other words, the goal was to provide a stream that provides an efficient access to the underlying buffer uses a fixed-size pre-allocated buffer One of the problems is that up until P0408R7, there was no non-copying access to the internal buffer of a std::basic_stringbuf so getting the results of ostringstream always required a copy of the internal buffer, even if one doesn’t want to use the stream afterwards. P0408R7 solved this problem. With the acceptance of the other discussed paper, P0448R4, spanstreams provide us a stream whose internal storage can use a fixed-size, pre-allocated buffer. That can be something on the stack, for example, a non-owning array view, std::span&lt;T&gt;. By using std::span&lt;T&gt;, we can represent and pass a buffer for a new spanstream and avoid any dynamic (re)allocation which might not be acceptable for you depending on your use case. The first step towards removing the deprecated stream buffer In P0408R7, the author shares his belief that basic_strbuf should be removed from the [depr.str.strstreams] section of the standard as soon as the feature is completely replaced. The reason why strstream was deprecated in the first place is that it returned a char* which was difficult to manage and therefore it was prone to cause memory leaks.

The only satisfactory deallocation was via the std::strstream::freeze() function, but it was not obvious, hence lots of people got it wrong. On the other hand, stringstreams return std::strings which manage their own memory allocations. The first step towards that removal was to extend the API of basic_stringbuf (note the difference between basic_strbuf and basic_stringbuf). std::string_view was introduced by C++17 to provide efficient read-only access to continuous sequence of characters. A basic_stringbuf has similar characteristics so it was a natural and highly waited-for step forward to provide a string_view-like access to its internal buffer. P0408R7 brought the below changes to basic_stringbuf in C++20. Somewhat accidentally, it introduced allocator-aware construction. I’m using the word “accidentally” because the author of these papers shared with me, that this was not part of his original intentions. But the papers were proposed around when the standard library itself made allocator support more flexible with stateful allocators and std::pmr, etc. At the same time, basic_stringbuf is also benefiting from new constructor overloads taking an initial value by rvalue-reference which again is about avoiding unnecessary copies. basic_stringbuf::str() went through several changes. First, we must remind ourselves that basic_stringbuf::str() is both a getter and a setter depending on its return type and parameters. The getter str() now has an overload that is used when the underlying object is an lvalue and another form rvalues. When str() is called on an rvalue reference, it returns the underlying string by moving it away from the internal buffer. According to the author, this is probably the first ref-qualified member function in the standard library. Moreover, in this case, the standard clearly specifies how the moved-from object should look like. Its buffer becomes empty. str() also received an overload with an allocator which sets how to copy the underlying buffer into the returned string. Of course, this is only for the no-move overload. There is also a new method called view() that is both const and noexcept and returns a string_view so that you can have a no-copy, not-owning, read-only access to the contents of the internal buffer. 1 2 3 4 5 6 basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt; str() const &amp;; // The &amp; lvalue qualifier is new! template&lt;class SAlloc&gt; basic_string&lt;charT,traits,SAlloc&gt; str(const SAlloc&amp; sa) const; // this is a new overload basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt; str() &amp;&amp;; // this is a new overload basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; view() const noexcept; // this is a new method The setter str() methods also received two new overloads. The original one takes a string using the same allocator as the basic_stringbuf class and takes the string by const&amp;. There is a new overload that still takes the input string by const&amp; but with a different allocator and another one that takes the string by rvalue reference, so it moves it to the internal buffer. 1 2 3 4 5 void str(const basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;&amp; s); // this was already there template&lt;class SAlloc&gt; void str(const basic_string&lt;charT, traits, SAlloc&gt;&amp; s); // this is a new overload void str(basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;&amp;&amp; s); // this is a new overload There are several other changes in which we are not going into details, but it’s worth noting that basic_stringbuf::swap() became conditionally noexcept depending on the used allocator. Probably the most important change among the above is that now you can get the contents of basic_stringbuf without actually having to make a copy of the internal buffer. Either it will be moved if you use str() &amp;&amp; or you get a read-only view on it if you use view. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 #include &lt;sstream&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { std::stringbuf buf; std::string temp {&quot;Some content&quot;}; buf.str(std::move(temp)); // now temp is moved away from, who knows what&#39;s inside std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;temp: &quot; &lt;&lt; temp &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; // no copy is needed to access the internal buffer std::string_view bufview = buf.view(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;bufview: &quot; &lt;&lt; bufview &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; // no copy is needed to access the internal buffer which still contains the data we put in it std::string_view anotherView = buf.view(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;anotherView: &quot; &lt;&lt; anotherView &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; // still no copy, buf is used as an rvalue-reference, the internal buffer is moved out std::string internalBufferMoved = std::move(buf).str(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;internalBufferMoved: &quot; &lt;&lt; internalBufferMoved &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; // now buf is moved away from, who knows what&#39;s inside std::string_view viewOnMovedObject = buf.view(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;viewOnMovedObject: &quot; &lt;&lt; viewOnMovedObject &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; return 0; } /* temp: bufview: Some content anotherView: Some content internalBufferMoved: Some content viewOnMovedObject: */ Notice in the above example, how efficiently views and moves are used in order to avoid expensive copy operations. Introducing the new &lt;spanstream&gt; header The second proposal, P0448R4, introduces a complete new header &lt;spanstream&gt; mainly with 4 class templates: std::basic_spanbuf std::basic_ispanstream std::basic_ospanstream std::basic_spanstream Basically what we get are the usual 3 streams and an externally provided memory buffer for them. spanstreams do not own the internal buffer, hence the name span, which is a non-owning view on an array of items. Therefore re-allocation is also not possible. If you need dynamic reallocation, you need to use stringstream et al. A stringstream has no-copy access to its contents since C++20. As a consequence of this hew header and the explained changes to basic_stringbuf, there is no more reason to keep the already deprecated strstream classes in the standard, and the [depr.str.strstreams] section is getting removed. Not surprisingly a basic_spanbuf uses a span of a sort of character (charT) as an internal buffer. It’s safe and cheap to provide access to it, as it requires no copy of the data. If you need an owning copy of the data, you can always convert the result of span() back to basic_string&lt;charT&gt; and as such copy it for yourself. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;span&gt; #include &lt;spanstream&gt; #include &lt;cassert&gt; void printSpan(auto spanToPrint) { for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; spanToPrint.size(); ++i) { std::cout &lt;&lt; spanToPrint[i]; } } void useSpanbuf() { std::array&lt;char, 16&gt; charArray; std::span&lt;char, 16&gt; charArraySpan(charArray); std::spanbuf buf; char c = &#39;a&#39;; for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i) { charArraySpan[i] = c; ++c; } buf.span(charArraySpan); // we can easily print a span got from the buffer std::span bufview = buf.span(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;bufview: &quot;; for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i) { std::cout &lt;&lt; bufview[i]; } std::cout &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; } void useSpanstream() { std::array&lt;char, 16&gt; charArray; std::ospanstream oss(charArray); oss &lt;&lt; &quot;Fortytwo is &quot; &lt;&lt; 42; // copying the contents to a span std::string s{oss.span().data(),size_t(oss.span().size())}; assert(s == &quot;Fortytwo is 42&quot;); } int main() { useSpanbuf(); useSpanstream(); return 0; } Conclusion In this post, we had a brief overview of how the world of buffers and streams has changed in C++20 and C++23 thanks to Peter Sommerlad and his two proposals, P0448R4, P0408R7. With P0408R7 we get non-copying access to the internal buffer of a std::basic_stringbuf which is a significant efficiency increase. With the acceptance of P0448R4 and the introduction of spanstreams, we get a stream that as an internal storage can use a fixed-size pre-allocated buffer.

Either it will be moved if you use str() &amp;&amp; or you get a read-only view on it if you use view. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 #include &lt;sstream&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { std::stringbuf buf; std::string temp {&quot;Some content&quot;}; buf.str(std::move(temp)); // now temp is moved away from, who knows what&#39;s inside std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;temp: &quot; &lt;&lt; temp &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;; // no copy is needed to access the internal buffer std::string_view bufview = buf.view(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;bufview: &quot; &lt;&lt; bufview &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;; // no copy is needed to access the internal buffer which still contains the data we put in it std::string_view anotherView = buf.view(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;anotherView: &quot; &lt;&lt; anotherView &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;; // still no copy, buf is used as an rvalue-reference, the internal buffer is moved out std::string internalBufferMoved = std::move(buf).str(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;internalBufferMoved: &quot; &lt;&lt; internalBufferMoved &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;; // now buf is moved away from, who knows what&#39;s inside std::string_view viewOnMovedObject = buf.view(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;viewOnMovedObject: &quot; &lt;&lt; viewOnMovedObject &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;; return 0; } /* temp: bufview: Some content anotherView: Some content internalBufferMoved: Some content viewOnMovedObject: */ Notice in the above example, how efficiently views and moves are used in order to avoid expensive copy operations. Introducing the new &lt;spanstream&gt; header The second proposal, P0448R4, introduces a complete new header &lt;spanstream&gt; mainly with 4 class templates: std::basic_spanbuf std::basic_ispanstream std::basic_ospanstream std::basic_spanstream Basically what we get are the usual 3 streams and an externally provided memory buffer for them. spanstreams do not own the internal buffer, hence the name span, which is a non-owning view on an array of items. Therefore re-allocation is also not possible. If you need dynamic reallocation, you need to use stringstream et al. A stringstream has no-copy access to its contents since C++20. As a consequence of this hew header and the explained changes to basic_stringbuf, there is no more reason to keep the already deprecated strstream classes in the standard, and the [depr.str.strstreams] section is getting removed. Not surprisingly a basic_spanbuf uses a span of a sort of character (charT) as an internal buffer. It’s safe and cheap to provide access to it, as it requires no copy of the data. If you need an owning copy of the data, you can always convert the result of span() back to basic_string&lt;charT&gt; and as such copy it for yourself. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;span&gt; #include &lt;spanstream&gt; #include &lt;cassert&gt; void printSpan(auto spanToPrint) { for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; spanToPrint.size(); ++i) { std::cout &lt;&lt; spanToPrint[i]; } } void useSpanbuf() { std::array&lt;char, 16&gt; charArray; std::span&lt;char, 16&gt; charArraySpan(charArray); std::spanbuf buf; char c = &#39;a&#39;; for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i) { charArraySpan[i] = c; ++c; } buf.span(charArraySpan); // we can easily print a span got from the buffer std::span bufview = buf.span(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;bufview: &quot;; for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i) { std::cout &lt;&lt; bufview[i]; } std::cout &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;; } void useSpanstream() { std::array&lt;char, 16&gt; charArray; std::ospanstream oss(charArray); oss &lt;&lt; &quot;Fortytwo is &quot; &lt;&lt; 42; // copying the contents to a span std::string s{oss.span().data(),size_t(oss.span().size())}; assert(s == &quot;Fortytwo is 42&quot;); } int main() { useSpanbuf(); useSpanstream(); return 0; } Conclusion In this post, we had a brief overview of how the world of buffers and streams has changed in C++20 and C++23 thanks to Peter Sommerlad and his two proposals, P0448R4, P0408R7. With P0408R7 we get non-copying access to the internal buffer of a std::basic_stringbuf which is a significant efficiency increase. With the acceptance of P0448R4 and the introduction of spanstreams, we get a stream that as an internal storage can use a fixed-size pre-allocated buffer.

In other words, the goal was to provide a stream that</p><ul><li>provides an efficient access to the underlying buffer<li>uses a fixed-size pre-allocated buffer</ul><p>One of the problems is that up until <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0408r7.pdf">P0408R7</a>, there was no non-copying access to the internal buffer of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::basic_stringbuf</code> so getting the results of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ostringstream</code> always required a copy of the internal buffer, even if one doesn’t want to use the stream afterwards. <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0408r7.pdf">P0408R7</a> solved this problem.</p><p>With the acceptance of the other discussed paper, <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p0448r4.pdf">P0448R4</a>, <em>spanstreams</em> provide us a stream whose internal storage can use a fixed-size, pre-allocated buffer.

This difficulty came from the fact that it was nowhere stated how and where it had been allocated. The only satisfactory deallocation was via the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/strstream/freeze"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::strstream::freeze()</code> function</a>, but it was not obvious, hence lots of people got it wrong. On the other hand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stringstream</code>s return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string</code>s which manage their own memory allocations.</p></blockquote><p>The first step towards that removal was to extend the API of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf</code> (note the difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_strbuf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf</code>). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string_view</code> was introduced by C++17 to provide efficient read-only access to continuous sequence of characters. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf</code> has similar characteristics so it was a natural and highly waited-for step forward to provide a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string_view</code>-like access to its internal buffer.</p><p><a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0408r7.pdf">P0408R7</a> brought the below changes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf</code> in C++20.</p><p>Somewhat accidentally, it introduced allocator-aware construction. I’m using the word “accidentally” because the author of these papers shared with me, that this was not part of his original intentions. But the papers were proposed around when the standard library itself made allocator support more flexible with stateful allocators and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::pmr</code>, etc.</p><p>At the same time, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf</code> is also benefiting from new constructor overloads taking an initial value by rvalue-reference which again is about avoiding unnecessary copies.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf::str()</code> went through several changes. First, we must remind ourselves that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf::str()</code> is both a getter and a setter depending on its return type and parameters.</p><p>The getter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str()</code> now has an overload that is used when the underlying object is an lvalue and another form rvalues. When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str()</code> is <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2018/11/25/override-r-and-l0-values#use--for-declaring-rvalue-references">called on an rvalue reference</a>, it returns the underlying string by moving it away from the internal buffer. According to the author, this is probably the first ref-qualified member function in the standard library. Moreover, in this case, the standard clearly specifies how the moved-from object should look like. Its buffer becomes empty.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str()</code> also received an overload with an allocator which sets how to copy the underlying buffer into the returned string. Of course, this is only for the no-move overload.</p><p>There is also a new method called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">view()</code> that is both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">noexcept</code> and returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string_view</code> so that you can have a no-copy, not-owning, read-only access to the contents of the internal buffer.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

Therefore re-allocation is also not possible. If you need dynamic reallocation, you need to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stringstream</code> et al. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stringstream</code> has no-copy access to its contents since C++20.</p><p>As a consequence of this hew header and the explained changes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_stringbuf</code>, there is no more reason to keep the already deprecated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strstream</code> classes in the standard, and the <em>[depr.str.strstreams]</em> section is getting removed.</p><p>Not surprisingly a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_spanbuf</code> uses a span of a sort of character (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">charT</code>) as an internal buffer. It’s safe and cheap to provide access to it, as it requires no copy of the data. If you need an owning copy of the data, you can always convert the result of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">span()</code> back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basic_string&lt;charT&gt;</code> and as such copy it for yourself.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
