The &lt;stdatomic.h&gt; header Originally, atomics for C and C++ were designed together. The aim was to make the non-generic pieces of the C++ atomics library usable as a C library. Due to some design decisions during C++11 and C++14 standardization, this aim was not reached. As a consequence, if you want to use atomics and want to write code that is portable between C and C++, you’ll probably end up using preprocessor macros to decide which header to include. In case of C++, you’ll also import the necessary types to the global namespace. (The below example is taken from the proposal) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 #ifdef __cplusplus #include &lt;atomic&gt; using std::atomic_int; using std::memory_order; using std::memory_order_acquire; ... #else /* not __cplusplus */ #include &lt;stdatomic.h&gt; #endif /* __cplusplus */ ... int saturated_fetch_add(atomic_int *loc, int value, memory_order order); Please note that this approach assumes that C and C++ representations of atomics are compatible. P0943R6 proposes the introduction of the header called &lt;stdatomic.h&gt; which will “mirror the identically named C header, and provide comparable functionality”. This header does 3 things: It includes the &lt;atomic&gt; C++ header Defines a macro such as atomic_generic_type(T) as std::atomic&lt;T&gt;. This assumes that C would correspondingly define atomic_generic_type(T) as _Atomic(T). Introduces types in the std namespace starting with atomic_ and memory_oder_ to the global namespace through aliases. The proposal doesn’t look for providing equivalence between C and C++ implementations, as it wants to avoid significant language changes. It provides the minimum required to conveniently use atomics in shared headers. Labels at the end of compound statements There is another proposal accepted to C++23 due to compatibility reasons with C, P2324R2. Labels show that compatibility-fueled changes go both ways. Earlier, a change was adopted for C2x allowing placing labels everywhere inside a compound statement, even in front of the declaration. Let’s demonstrate it with an example. 1 2 3 4 void foo() { first: int x; } The label first used to be allowed only in C++, but not in C. It’s due to grammar differences between the two languages. In C, declarations and statements are separate production rules and they can both appear as block-items inside compound statements. To fix the above difference, C allowed also labels as independent block items. But that led to another difference. Now in C, you can put a label at the end of a compound statement. 1 2 3 4 5 void foo() { // some code /// ... last_label: } In C++, labels can be attached to all statements, but they cannot be placed at the end of a compound statement, so the above example is invalid in C++. At least it used to be. The change proposal is accepted for C++23, GCC 13 and Clang 16 already implemented it. Conclusion In this article, we reviewed two changes aiming for higher compatibility with C. The introduction of &lt;stdatomic.h&gt; header makes it easier to have shared headers between C anc C++ when atomics are used. The second change allows to have labels at the end of compound statements, so for example at the very of a function. But we also saw that it’s not only C++ that introduces compatibility changes but also C when it started to allow having labels in front of variable declarations.

This assumes that C would correspondingly define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomic_generic_type(T)</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_Atomic(T)</code>.<li>Introduces types in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std</code> namespace starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomic_</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memory_oder_</code> to the global namespace through aliases.</ul><p>The proposal doesn’t look for providing equivalence between C and C++ implementations, as it wants to avoid significant language changes. It provides the minimum required to conveniently use atomics in shared headers.</p><h2 id="labels-at-the-end-of-compound-statements">Labels at the end of compound statements</h2><p>There is another proposal accepted to C++23 due to compatibility reasons with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code>, <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2324r2.pdf">P2324R2</a>.</p><p>Labels show that compatibility-fueled changes go both ways. Earlier, a change was adopted for C2x allowing placing labels everywhere inside a compound statement, even in front of the declaration. Let’s demonstrate it with an example.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

		<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></table></code></div></div><p>The label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first</code> used to be allowed only in C++, but not in C. It’s due to grammar differences between the two languages. In C, declarations and statements are separate production rules and they can both appear as block-items inside compound statements. To fix the above difference, C allowed also labels as independent block items. But that led to another difference. Now in C, you can put a label at the end of a compound statement.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>In C++, labels can be attached to all statements, but they cannot be placed at the end of a compound statement, so the above example is invalid in C++. At least it used to be. The change proposal is accepted for C++23, GCC 13 and Clang 16 already implemented it.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we reviewed two changes aiming for higher compatibility with C. The introduction of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</code> header makes it easier to have shared headers between C anc C++ when atomics are used. The second change allows to have labels at the end of compound statements, so for example at the very of a function. But we also saw that it’s not only C++ that introduces compatibility changes but also C when it started to allow having labels in front of variable declarations. By the way, who is using labels in new code?</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left;
