I think there aren’t many good reasons to use it — something the C++ Core Guidelines also suggests. And even when you could use it, you probably shouldn’t. final is not technically a keyword, it’s an “identifier with special meaning”. It can be used as a name for objects or functions, but if used in the right place, it gains special behavior. For readable code, though, don’t use it as an identifier! Let’s start with a quick recap of the final specifier, then move on to a nasty example I recently ran into. What is final In C++, final is a specifier used to prevent further derivation or overriding. It can be applied to both classes and virtual functions. final classes When final is applied to a class, it prevents other classes from inheriting from it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 class Base {}; class Derived final : public Base {}; // OK class AnotherDerived : public Derived {}; // Error! Derived is final final virtual functions When final is applied to a virtual function, it prevents derived classes from overriding it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 class Base { public: virtual void foo() {} // void bar() final {} // error: only virtual member functions can be marked &#39;final&#39; }; class Derived : public Base { public: void foo() final {} }; class AnotherDerived : public Derived { // void foo() override {} // error: foo() is marked final in Derived }; It’s worth noting that you cannot mark a non-virtual function as final. When to use it? Don’t use final a lot. More than that, use it less than you probably would! The Core Guidelines talks about final usage in two rules. C.139 says that you should use final on classes sparingly. The reason? It’s rarely needed for logical reasons and can hurt the extensibility of your class hierarchies. Some claim that marking classes final improves performance, but that’s more of an urban legend — or at least only true in specific cases. As always: measure. In the next section, I’ll show how a final class can be too limiting. Before that, let’s briefly mention the other rule, C.128. It says that (virtual) functions should specify exactly one of virtual, override or final. Using only one is explicit and precise: virtual -&gt; “this is a new virtual function”. override -&gt; “this is a non-final overrider” final -&gt; “this is a final overrider.” Though you should use final on functions just as sparignly as on classes. Don’t use final on mocks! Recently, I was cleaning up the outputs of a test harness. To reduce noise, I decided to wrap a mock class with NiceMock&lt;T&gt;. If you set no expectations on a mocked call, but it’s invoked, the test harness will report “uninteresting calls”. Using NiceMock&lt;T&gt; suppresses those. If you use StrictMock&lt;T&gt;, uninteresting calls will cause test failures. Look for more info here. When I tried to compile, it failed! After some wondering and digging, I discovered that NiceMock&lt;T&gt; and StrictMock&lt;T&gt; both inherit from T. In fact, they use the CRTP design pattern. So, if you try to use NiceMock&lt;T&gt; on a class T that has been marked final then the compilation will fail, because NiceMock cannot inherit from T. Too bad… If you have the rights to change the source code of T, good for you. Go ahead and consider remove final from class declaration. If you cannot do that, you might ask the owners to do so or you simply have to give up on using NiceMock. Nevertheless, if you are using gmock and you are writing some mock classes, don’t mark then final. Don’t make life harder for your users or for yourself. Conclusion In this article, we talked about the final specifier. You can use it on classes and member functions to prevent inheritance and overrides, respectively. While it may seem useful at first glance, it doesn’t offer performance benefits in most cases—and it often just adds unnecessary constraints. That’s why the Core Guidelines recommend using it sparingly. We saw a concrete example where marking a mock class as final prevented its use with NiceMock&lt;T&gt; or StrictMock&lt;T&gt;, since they inherit from the mock class behind the scenes.

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>It’s worth noting that you cannot mark a non-virtual function as final.</p><h2 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it?</h2><p>Don’t use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> a lot. More than that, use it <em>less</em> than you probably would! The Core Guidelines talks about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> usage in two rules.</p><p><a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c139-use-final-on-classes-sparingly">C.139</a> says that you should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> on classes sparingly. The reason? It’s rarely needed for logical reasons and can hurt the extensibility of your class hierarchies.</p><p>Some claim that marking classes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> improves performance, but that’s more of an urban legend — or at least only true in specific cases. As always: <strong>measure</strong>.</p><p>In the next section, I’ll show how a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> class can be too limiting.</p><p>Before that, let’s briefly mention the other rule, <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c128-virtual-functions-should-specify-exactly-one-of-virtual-override-or-final">C.128</a>. It says that (virtual) functions should specify exactly one of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">override</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code>. Using only one is explicit and precise:</p><ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual</code> -&gt; “this is a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual</code> function”.<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">override</code> -&gt; “this is a non-final overrider”<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> -&gt; “this is a final overrider.”</ul><p>Though you should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> on functions just as sparignly as on classes.</p><h2 id="dont-use-final-on-mocks">Don’t use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> on mocks!</h2><p>Recently, I was cleaning up the outputs of a test harness. To reduce noise, I decided to wrap a mock class with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NiceMock&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p><blockquote><p>If you set no expectations on a mocked call, but it’s invoked, the test harness will report “uninteresting calls”. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NiceMock&lt;T&gt;</code> suppresses those. If you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StrictMock&lt;T&gt;</code>, uninteresting calls will cause test failures. <em><a href="https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#NiceStrictNaggy">Look for more info here</a></em>.</p></blockquote><p>When I tried to compile, it failed! After some wondering and digging, I discovered that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NiceMock&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StrictMock&lt;T&gt;</code> both inherit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>. In fact, they use the <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2019/03/13/the-curiously-recurring-templatep-pattern-CRTP">CRTP</a> design pattern. So, if you try to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NiceMock&lt;T&gt;</code> on a class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> that has been marked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> then the compilation will fail, because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NiceMock</code> cannot inherit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>.</p><p>Too bad…</p><p>If you have the rights to change the source code of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, good for you. Go ahead and consider remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> from class declaration. If you cannot do that, you might ask the owners to do so or you simply have to give up on using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NiceMock</code>.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you are using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gmock</code> and you are writing some mock classes, don’t mark then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code>. Don’t make life harder for your users or for yourself.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we talked about the final specifier. You can use it on classes and member functions to prevent inheritance and overrides, respectively.</p><p>While it may seem useful at first glance, it doesn’t offer performance benefits in most cases—and it often just adds unnecessary constraints. That’s why the Core Guidelines recommend using it sparingly.</p><p>We saw a concrete example where marking a mock class as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> prevented its use with<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> NiceMock&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StrictMock&lt;T&gt;</code>, since they inherit from the mock class behind the scenes.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a></ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/dev/'>dev</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/testing/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >testing</a> <a href="/tags/tdd/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >tdd</a> <a href="/tags/unittesting/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >unittesting</a> <a href="/tags/final/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >final</a> <a href="/tags/mocking/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >mocking</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a><div class="share-wrapper"> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Should you use final?
