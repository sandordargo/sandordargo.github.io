We saw the three pillars of the library: time_points, durations and clocks from a birds-eye view. As a next step, let’s talk about one of its most commonly used clocks: std::chrono::system_clock. If you’ve ever logged timestamps or printed the current time, there is a fair chance that you’ve already used it. But let’s take a closer look at what this clock really represents and where its limitations lie. What system_clock representes std::chrono::system_clock measures the system-wide wall-clock time, in other words, the same time you’d see on your watch or system tray. It reflects real-world calendar time — hours, minutes, seconds, and dates that we humans care about. Internally, it still counts ticks (just like every clock in &lt;chrono&gt;), but those ticks are anchored to the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). Even that’s not mandated by the standard. When you ask it for the current time you get a time_point representing that instant: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 #include &lt;chrono&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;now: &quot; &lt;&lt; now &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; return 0; } /* now: 2025-11-10 05:43:45.622822844 */ Converting Between time_point and time_t Because system_clock represents real-world time, it’s often useful or simply needed to convert it to a time_t for display or interop with older APIs: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 #include &lt;chrono&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now(); std::time_t now_c = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(now); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Current time: &quot; &lt;&lt; std::ctime(&amp;now_c); return 0; } /* Current time: Mon Nov 10 05:45:35 2025 */ And if you ever need to go the other way: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 #include &lt;chrono&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr); auto time_point = std::chrono::system_clock::from_time_t(t); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;time_point: &quot; &lt;&lt; time_point &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; return 0; } /* time_point: 2025-11-10 05:47:33.000000000 */ This interoperability is one reason system_clock is so handy in everyday applications — it bridges the modern C++ &lt;chrono&gt; world and the old-school C time APIs. When to use system_clock Use system_clock whenever you care about timestamps that make sense to humans: Logging messages (e.g. [2025-11-10 08:34:56] User logged in) File metadata (modification times, creation times) Saving or displaying dates in a user interface Basically, when your program needs to express “what time it is in the real world”, system_clock is the right tool. When not to use it If your goal is to measure durations — like how long a function call takes, or how much time elapsed between two events — then system_clock is not a good choice. The reasong behind is that wall-clock time can jump backwards or forwards: The user changes the system clock manually. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) adjusts the system time slightly to stay in sync. As Ingo Van Lil pointed out at the comments section, DST changes do not affect system_clock In such cases, your measurements won’t be precise, they might suddenly show negative durations or too big results. For accurate timing, you should use std::chrono::steady_clock instead — it never goes backward. More about that in the next part of this series. What about testing Tests that depend on real-world time are often flaky. If your code calls system_clock::now() directly, it ties the behavior of your tests to the passage of real time — and that makes them unreliable and slow. For example: 1 EXPECT_TRUE(order.expires_at &gt; std::chrono::system_clock::now()); This might pass on your machine but fail on CI if the system clock drifts, or if execution timing slightly changes. A better approach is to wrap or abstract the clock: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 struct Clock { virtual std::chrono::system_clock::time_point now() const = 0; virtual ~Clock() = default; }; struct RealClock : Clock { std::chrono::system_clock::time_point now() const override { return std::chrono::system_clock::now(); } }; struct FakeClock : Clock { std::chrono::system_clock::time_point provided{}; std::chrono::system_clock::time_point now() const override { return provided; } }; Now your production code depends on Clock, not on system_clock directly, and in tests you can inject FakeClock and control time deterministically. This kind of abstraction makes your tests stable, reproducible, and fast — no waiting, no flakiness, no surprises. Conclusion Today, we looked into probably the most widely used standard clock, std::chrono::system_clock. It returns the real-world time. It’s the best for timestamps and also to interact with old C APIs. On the other hand, it’s not good for measurements because this clock can jump due to manual adjustments and for NTP syncs. For testing purposes, it’s the best wrap it so that we can fake the current time. Next week, we will explore steady_clock which is more sutable for measuring durations.

We saw the three pillars of the library: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">time_point</code>s, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">duration</code>s and clocks from a birds-eye view. As a next step, let’s talk about one of its most commonly used clocks: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::system_clock</code>.</p><p>If you’ve ever logged timestamps or printed the current time, there is a fair chance that you’ve already used it. But let’s take a closer look at what this clock really represents and where its limitations lie.</p><h2 id="what-system_clock-representes">What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system_clock</code> representes</h2><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::chrono::system_clock</code> measures the system-wide <strong>wall-clock</strong> time, in other words, the same time you’d see on your watch or system tray. It reflects real-world calendar time — hours, minutes, seconds, and dates that we humans care about.</p><p>Internally, it still counts ticks (just like every clock in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;chrono&gt;</code>), but those ticks are anchored to the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). Even that’s not mandated by the standard.</p><p>When you ask it for the current time you get a time_point representing that instant:</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
