The problem is that with higher warning levels (-Wunused-variable), our compilation might fail because _ is unused. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 int foo() { return 42; } auto _ = foo(); /* error: unused variable &#39;_&#39; [-Werror,-Wunused-variable] */ To avoid this problem, we must mark it [[maybe_unused]]. 1 2 3 4 5 int foo() { return 42; } [[maybe_unused]] auto _ = foo(); // OK now But what if we want to ignore several of them? 1 2 3 4 5 int foo() { return 42; } char bar() { return &#39;c&#39;; } [[maybe_unused]] auto _ = foo(); [[maybe_unused]] auto _ = bar(); In this case, even [[maybe_unused]] doesn’t help because _ is just a normal variable and is introduced twice. We can use std::ignore! 1 2 3 4 5 6 #include &lt;utility&gt; int foo() { return 42; } char bar() { return &#39;c&#39;; } std::ignore = foo(); std::ignore = bar(); But even this solution won’t work all the time. We cannot use it with structured bindings, which are probably the most often used place where _ is used as variable names. And if you want to use _ with various structured bindings in the same (nested) scope, you have to look for other solutions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 std::map&lt;int, std::tuple&lt;std::string, std::string, std::string&gt;&gt; m{ {1, {&quot;one&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;}}, {2, {&quot;two&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;}}, {3, {&quot;three&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;}}}; for(const auto&amp; [_, v]: m) { const auto&amp; [e, r, _] = v; // ERROR: error: redefinition of &#39;_&#39;! std::cout &lt;&lt; e &lt;&lt; &quot; in Roman format &quot; &lt;&lt; r &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; } The above piece of code will not compile, because we try to redefine _! In some cases, we can easily remove one of the ignored variables with the help of ranges! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #include &lt;ranges&gt; std::map&lt;int, std::tuple&lt;std::string, std::string, std::string&gt;&gt; m{ {1, {&quot;one&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;}}, {2, {&quot;two&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;}}, {3, {&quot;three&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;}}}; for(const auto&amp; v: m | std::views::values) { const auto&amp; [e, r, _] = v; std::cout &lt;&lt; e &lt;&lt; &quot; in Roman format &quot; &lt;&lt; r &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; } But this won’t be possible all the time.

The new solution The solution that is brought to us with the acceptance of P2169R4 is simple. We can use _ as a placeholder in the same scope as many times as we want. This solution is also similar to other languages’ features or conventions and it’s not unfamiliar at all from existing C++ practices. It already carries the meaning of “I don’t want to use this variable”. In more - but not too - technical terms, if we introduce _ as a variable, a non-static class member, a lambda capture or in a structured binding, it will implicitly get the [[maybe_unused]] attribute. In addition, we can also redeclare it as many times as we want it. On the other hand, if we try to use _ in any expression, the program is ill-formed! The new placeholder has certain limits, it cannot be used in template parameter lists or in requires clauses.

The library that might come into most of our minds is GMock, where _ is used to match any input passed to a function.
