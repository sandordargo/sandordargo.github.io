You probably also read my CppCon 2025 Trip Report. And this post is where the two come together. At CppCon I attended a great talk by Steve Downey about std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;. Steve is the father of optional references—he co-authored P2988R12 with Peter Sommerlad. Let’s start with a little history. By now — at the end of 2025 — even C++17 feels like history. That’s when std::optional&lt;T&gt; was introduced, giving us a way to represent “maybe a value” with value semantics, instead of relying on pointers. But std::optional in C++17 (and later) couldn’t hold references — unless you wrapped them in std::reference_wrapper. C++26 finally fixes this gap. What is std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;? std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; has three key characteristics: Unlike std::optional&lt;T&gt;, it is not an owning type. It simply refers to an existing object. It provides both reference and value-like semantics. Internally, it behaves like a pointer to T, which may also be nullptr. This last point is interesting: while optional&lt;T&gt; can be seen as variant&lt;T, monostate&gt;, optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; is closer to variant&lt;T&amp;, nullptr_t&gt;. In practice, it’s a safer alternative to a non-owning raw pointer. Does this mean one less reason to use raw pointers? Well, owning raw pointers have been discouraged since C++11. Non-owning raw pointers are still common for expressing “I don’t own this.” With C++26, optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; might replace many of those cases. You’ll still need to check engagement, but at least it’s more expressive than sprinkling nullptr checks everywhere. Key considerations The design of std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; aimed for the least surprising and least dangerous behavior. Let’s walk through some of the decisions. Assign or Rebind? Consider this snippet (from Steve Downey’s CppCon talk): 1 2 3 4 5 6 Cat fynn; Cat loki; std::optional&lt;Cat&amp;&gt; maybeCat1; std::optional&lt;Cat&amp;&gt; maybeCat2{fynn}; maybeCat1 = fynn; maybeCat2 = loki; What should these assignments do? Should they copy objects or rebind references? If they were true assignments, maybeCat2 = loki; would copy loki into fynn. That would have been surprising and error-prone. Instead, the committee decided that operator= for optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; always rebinds the reference. At the end of the snippet: maybeCat1 refers to fynn maybeCat2 now refers to loki, not fynn. This design makes the behavior consistent and avoids accidental copies. What about make_optional()? make_optional() returns an optional&lt;T&gt;, not optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;. Even if you pass a reference, it still creates an owning optional. This is intentional: allowing make_optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; would lead to dangling references. In practice, make_optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; was mostly used in test cases. With C++26, you’ll need to construct optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; directly if you want an optional reference. The question of constness Should optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; model shallow or deep const? For a const optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;, should operator*() and operator-&gt;() yield T&amp; or const T&amp;? The designers chose shallow constness: dereferencing a const optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; still gives you a non-const T&amp;. If you need deep constness, you can use optional&lt;const T&amp;&gt;. The least dangerous value_or What about value_or? For optional&lt;T&gt;, it returns a T. For optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;, the safest design turned out to be the same: value_or returns a T (by value). This avoids surprising reference semantics, and it supports common use cases like providing a literal fallback: 1 auto name = maybeName.value_or(&quot;Anonymous&quot;s); Steve also mentions in the paper future proposals for free functions like reference_or, value_or, or_invoke, and yield_if for all optional-like types. Stay tuned — I’ll probably cover those here soon. Conclusion std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; fills an important gap in the language. It gives us a safer and more expressive way to model maybe-a-reference, reducing our reliance on raw pointers and reference wrappers. It’s another step toward making code both more readable and less error-prone — two things I’m always happy to see in modern C++.

Steve is the <em>father of optional references</em>—he co-authored <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p2988r12.pdf">P2988R12</a> with Peter Sommerlad.</p><p>Let’s start with a little history. By now — at the end of 2025 — even C++17 feels like history. That’s when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional&lt;T&gt;</code> was introduced, giving us a way to represent “maybe a value” with value semantics, instead of relying on pointers. But <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional</code> in C++17 (and later) couldn’t hold references — unless you wrapped them in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::reference_wrapper</code>.</p><p>C++26 finally fixes this gap.</p><h2 id="what-is-stdoptionalt">What is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code>?</h2><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> has three key characteristics:</p><ul><li>Unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional&lt;T&gt;</code>, it is <strong>not an owning type</strong>. It simply refers to an existing object.<li>It provides both reference and value-like semantics.<li>Internally, it behaves like a pointer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, which may also be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code>.</ul><p>This last point is interesting: while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&gt;</code> can be seen as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variant&lt;T, monostate&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> is closer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variant&lt;T&amp;, nullptr_t&gt;</code>. In practice, it’s a safer alternative to a non-owning raw pointer.</p><p>Does this mean one less reason to use raw pointers?</p><p>Well, owning raw pointers have been discouraged since C++11. Non-owning raw pointers are still common for expressing “I don’t own this.” With C++26, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> might replace many of those cases. You’ll still need to check engagement, but at least it’s more expressive than sprinkling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullptr</code> checks everywhere.</p><h2 id="key-considerations">Key considerations</h2><p>The design of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> aimed for the <strong>least surprising and least dangerous behavior</strong>. Let’s walk through some of the decisions.</p><h3 id="assign-or-rebind">Assign or Rebind?</h3><p>Consider this snippet (from Steve Downey’s CppCon talk):</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

<span class="n">maybeCat1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fynn</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">maybeCat2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">loki</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></table></code></div></div><p>What should these assignments do? Should they copy objects or rebind references?</p><p>If they were true assignments, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maybeCat2 = loki;</code> would copy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loki</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fynn</code>. That would have been surprising and error-prone.</p><p>Instead, the committee decided that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator=</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> always rebinds the reference. At the end of the snippet:</p><ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maybeCat1</code> refers to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fynn</code><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maybeCat2</code> now refers to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loki</code>, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fynn</code>.</ul><p>This design makes the behavior consistent and avoids accidental copies.</p><h3 id="what-about-make_optional">What about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_optional()</code>?</h3><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_optional()</code> returns an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&gt;</code>, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code>. Even if you pass a reference, it still creates an owning optional. This is intentional: allowing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> would lead to dangling references.</p><p>In practice, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> was mostly used in test cases. With C++26, you’ll need to construct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> directly if you want an optional reference.</p><h3 id="the-question-of-constness">The question of constness</h3><p>Should <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> model shallow or deep const?</p><p>For a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code>, should <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator*()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator-&gt;()</code> yield <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T&amp;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const T&amp;</code>?</p><p>The designers chose shallow constness: dereferencing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> still gives you a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const T&amp;</code>. If you need deep constness, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;const T&amp;&gt;</code>.</p><h3 id="the-least-dangerous-value_or">The least dangerous <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value_or</code></h3><p>What about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value_or</code>?</p><p>For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&gt;</code>, it returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>. For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code>, the safest design turned out to be the same: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value_or</code> returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> (by value).</p><p>This avoids surprising reference semantics, and it supports common use cases like providing a literal fallback:</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>Steve also mentions in the paper future proposals for free functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reference_or</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value_or</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or_invoke</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield_if</code> for all optional-like types. Stay tuned — I’ll probably cover those here soon.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> fills an important gap in the language. It gives us a safer and more expressive way to model maybe-a-reference, reducing our reliance on raw pointers and reference wrappers.</p><p>It’s another step toward making code both more readable and less error-prone — two things I’m always happy to see in modern C++.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left;
