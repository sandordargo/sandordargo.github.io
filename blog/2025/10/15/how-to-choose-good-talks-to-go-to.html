That’s far from true! Europe’s largest C++ conference is still ahead of us: Meeting C++. At CppCon, I ended up sharing a table with Victor Ciura, and we had a great chat about career paths in C++ across different industries — and, naturally, about conferences themselves. One thing I remember from our discussion in particular is how C++ conferences tend to have several tracks running in parallel, often four or five at a time. In contrast, many conferences for other programming languages run only one or two tracks. Multiple tracks are great — they let everyone find their niche — but they also raise an important question: How do you decide which talk to attend? It might sound trivial, but choosing well can make a huge difference. Attending a conference is often a multi-thousand Euro or Dollar investment, not to mention the time away from work and family. How much you learn, how inspired you feel, and even how you think about the event afterward largely depend on the choices you make. Over the past few years, I’ve attended quite a few conferences, both in-person and online. I didn’t always choose well — sometimes I left a talk wishing I had picked differently. So, here are a few lessons learned that might help you, too. Let’s be clear: wanting to be somewhere else doesn’t mean the talk was bad. It might just not have been a good fit — maybe I already knew the material, or maybe the topic didn’t grab me after all. What Makes a Great Talk On the first evening of CppCon, I had a conversation with Peter Muldoon about what makes a truly exceptional talk. We identified three key ingredients: The talk must share interesting ideas. They don’t even have to be deeply technical — just thought - provoking or fresh. The presenter must deliver those ideas in an engaging way. This is often what separates a memorable talk from a forgettable one. The talk should energize you. The best sessions make you want to try something new as soon as you’re back at work. Of course, not every talk aims to be exceptional in that sense — and that’s okay. Some topics are niche or theoretical. But knowing what you want to get out of a session helps you choose more intentionally. Plan Before You Go The best time to plan your schedule is before the conference starts — on your flight, on the train, or while waiting at the airport. By then, most schedules are finalized (last-minute changes won’t ruin your whole plan). If you wait until the coffee breaks to decide, you might find yourself scrolling through the app instead of joining the most interesting track of all: the hallway track. This might sound evident, but don’t only read the titles, but also the talk descriptions before you make decisions. Titles can be intentionally catchy or ambiguous to attract more people. Make sure you read the available information before you draw conclusions and make decisions. At a C++ conference with multiple parallel sessions, you’ll usually face one of three situations: One talk clearly stands out. Great — go for it and enjoy. Several talks appeal to you at the same time. You’ll need to make a choice. None of the talks look interesting. That’s a choice, too. There is not much to talk about the first possibility, so let’s focus on the second and third. When You Can’t Decide Between Two Talks If you’re torn between two sessions: Check for overlap at other conferences. Maybe one of the talks will also appear later in the year elsewhere — go to the other now. See if one is already online. Many speakers give similar talks at different events. If one’s recorded, watch it later and attend the other live. Consider the speaker, not just the topic. A great presenter can make even a modest topic engaging. I’d rather attend a less exciting topic by a skilled, dynamic speaker than a fascinating subject delivered poorly. Prioritize onsite tracks. Some conferences run parallel onsite and online tracks. You can always watch the online talks later (and often they’re available almost immediately to attendees). The human interactions, spontaneous conversations, and hallway debates are irreplaceable. And sometimes, honestly — you’ll just flip a coin. That’s okay, too. When Nothing Grabs You If none of the parallel talks sound appealing: Pick based on the presenter. You might discover someone new and inspiring. Still, give new speakers a chance from time-to-time. Conferences constantly welcome fresh voices. I always make it a point to attend a few talks by people I don’t know — you never know when you’ll find the next great communicator. Or take a break. Conferences can be exhausting. It’s perfectly fine to skip a session, relax, or reflect on what you’ve learned. Sometimes the best insights come when you pause and digest. Conclusion Choosing conference talks wisely can turn a good event into a great one. Whether you’re looking to learn something new, connect with people, or recharge your motivation, the key is intentionality — know what you want and plan accordingly. After all, a conference isn’t just about talks. It’s about ideas, people, and the spark that happens when you bring them together.

It might just not have been a good fit — maybe I already knew the material, or maybe the topic didn’t grab me after all.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="what-makes-a-great-talk">What Makes a Great Talk</h2><p>On the first evening of CppCon, I had a conversation with <a href="https://cppcon2025.sched.com/speaker/petetheladd">Peter Muldoon</a> about what makes a truly exceptional talk. We identified three key ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>The talk must share interesting ideas</strong>. They don’t even have to be deeply technical — just thought - provoking or fresh.<li><strong>The presenter must deliver those ideas in an engaging way.</strong> This is often what separates a memorable talk from a forgettable one.<li><strong>The talk should energize you.</strong> The best sessions make you want to try something new as soon as you’re back at work.</ul><p>Of course, not every talk aims to be exceptional in that sense — and that’s okay. Some topics are niche or theoretical. But knowing what you want to get out of a session helps you choose more intentionally.</p><h2 id="plan-before-you-go">Plan Before You Go</h2><p>The best time to plan your schedule is before the conference starts — on your flight, on the train, or while waiting at the airport. By then, most schedules are finalized (last-minute changes won’t ruin your whole plan). If you wait until the coffee breaks to decide, you might find yourself scrolling through the app instead of joining the most interesting track of all: the hallway track.</p><blockquote><p><em>This might sound evident, but don’t only read the titles, but also the talk descriptions before you make decisions. Titles can be intentionally catchy or ambiguous to attract more people. Make sure you read the available information before you draw conclusions and make decisions.</em></p></blockquote><p>At a C++ conference with multiple parallel sessions, you’ll usually face one of three situations:</p><ul><li><strong>One talk clearly stands out.</strong> Great — go for it and enjoy.<li><strong>Several talks appeal to you at the same time.</strong> You’ll need to make a choice.<li><strong>None of the talks look interesting.</strong> That’s a choice, too.</ul><p>There is not much to talk about the first possibility, so let’s focus on the second and third.</p><h3 id="when-you-cant-decide-between-two-talks">When You Can’t Decide Between Two Talks</h3><p>If you’re torn between two sessions:</p><ul><li><strong>Check for overlap at other conferences.</strong> Maybe one of the talks will also appear later in the year elsewhere — go to the other now.<li><strong>See if one is already online.</strong> Many speakers give similar talks at different events. If one’s recorded, watch it later and attend the other live.<li><strong>Consider the speaker, not just the topic.</strong> A great presenter can make even a modest topic engaging. I’d rather attend a less exciting topic by a skilled, dynamic speaker than a fascinating subject delivered poorly.<li><strong>Prioritize onsite tracks.</strong> Some conferences run parallel onsite and online tracks. You can always watch the online talks later (and often they’re available almost immediately to attendees). The human interactions, spontaneous conversations, and hallway debates are irreplaceable.</ul><p>And sometimes, honestly — you’ll just flip a coin. That’s okay, too.</p><h3 id="when-nothing-grabs-you">When Nothing Grabs You</h3><p>If none of the parallel talks sound appealing:</p><ul><li><strong>Pick based on the presenter.</strong> You might discover someone new and inspiring.<li><strong>Still, give new speakers a chance from time-to-time.</strong> Conferences constantly welcome fresh voices. I always make it a point to attend a few talks by people I don’t know — you never know when you’ll find the next great communicator.<li><strong>Or take a break.</strong> Conferences can be exhausting. It’s perfectly fine to skip a session, relax, or reflect on what you’ve learned. Sometimes the best insights come when you pause and digest.</ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing conference talks wisely can turn a good event into a great one. Whether you’re looking to learn something new, connect with people, or recharge your motivation, the key is intentionality — know what you want and plan accordingly.</p><p>After all, a conference isn’t just about talks. It’s about ideas, people, and the spark that happens when you bring them together.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left;
