Surprisingly, even the lexing process in C++ can result in undefined behaviour. Thanks to Corentin Jabot’s work and his P2621R3 that won’t be the case anymore. As it was accepted as a defect report starting from C++98, in fact, you benefit from this already if you use a new enough compiler. Truth be told, compilers didn’t do any dangerous.

Unterminated strings 1 2 // unterminated string used to be UB const char * foo = &quot; Who would have thought that an unterminated string or a character was UB?! Despite the permissive standard, all major compilers identified it as ill-formed. From now on, even the standard says so. Universal character names produced by macros Universal character names (UCNs) in C++ are a way to represent Unicode characters in source code using a standardized syntax. They allow you to include characters that may not be directly representable in your source file encoding, such as non-ASCII characters or characters from other scripts. The syntax is either \uXXXX or \uXXXXXXX for 4- or 8-digit hexadecimal values. If you wrote macros that expanded to universal character names, you risked undefined behaviour! In reality, all major compilers supported this use case properly, and from now on the standard defines this. 1 2 #define CONCAT(x, y) x ## y int CONCAT(\, u0393) = 0; // UB: universal character name formed by macro expansion By the way, have you ever used the ## preprocessing token? I haven’t, at least I don’t remember. I haven’t written a macro for the last few years. So ## is called the token-pasting operator and lets us join separate tokens into one single, just like in the above example. Spliced universal character name According to the standard, if universal character names are spliced across lines, that’s also undefined behaviour. 1 2 3 4 5 6 int \\ // UB : universal character name accross spliced lines u\ 0\ 3\ 9\ 1 = 0; While the above was UB, all major compilers supported it except for MSVC which considered it an error.
