Depending on who you ask, maybe it’s not a lot — I know some speakers do twice as many. But if you ask my family, you’d probably get a different (and understandable) answer. For me — for us — it’s a lot. It’s also an honour and a privilege in many ways. To express my appreciation and gratitude toward the organizers and the community, I do two things: I try to prepare well for my talks. I post trip reports soon after each event — usually within a week. Those trip reports are moderately personal: I share which talks I liked and also some of my impressions, but I try to make them useful rather than purely personal. Still, I think that once in a while, a more personal, less serious post has its place — and that’s what this one wanted to be originally. At one of the social dinners at CppCon, a developer working for a FAANG company in New York asked me which conference I’d recommend. My answer: it depends on your goals — and your budget and constraints. Yes, goals. Maybe you just want to listen to good talks — in that case, even online formats can work! Maybe you want to meet other developers — then online isn’t as great. Or perhaps you want to travel somewhere new and tick off a bucket list item while attending a C++ event. Don’t judge, that’s perfectly fine! Maybe you can use a conference as an excuse to visit another part of the world and then explore the region afterwards. Each conference offers a different balance of technical depth, community feel, and travel experience. The conferences below are mentioned in alphabetical order. Also I only mention conferences which I’ve been to in 2025. There are many other great C++ conferences. CppCon: The Giant of the Scene CppCon is the biggest event — in attendance, venue, and content volume. That can be a strength or a drawback. You can find a talk for almost every niche interest. Unsurprisingly, the schedule is dense, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. It also requires more time even if you are from the US. Most other conferences take 3 days. CppCon is scheduled for 5 days. That excludes workshop days. It’s also quite a trip for those outside of North America. Traveling from Europe to Denver takes time and effort. Once you’re there, though, it’s immersive: talks sometimes start as early as 7:30 AM and often continue with sessions or social events past 9 PM. You’re there to make the most of it, and the atmosphere reflects that intensity. Denver itself is a pleasant city, but not the kind you explore by hopping on a tram from your hotel. If you don’t have a car, expect to spend about two hours overall commuting to and from downtown. I managed to squeeze in two visits — once between my arrival and the opening reception, and again after the conference ended. Yes, it can be tiring, but I don’t travel to the other side of the world just to stay at a hotel. Denver Downtown After CppCon, I was lucky to visit the Rockies with a new friend — we saw places I never imagined I’d reach. Driving through the mountains and visiting Bear Lake right before sunset were absolute highlights. View of the Rockies from the Trail Ridge Road C++ On Sea: Coastal Charm and Community Folkestone offers completely different vibes — a quiet coastal town with charming architecture, mild weather, and a walkable seafront. If I had to choose a place to live among Denver, Folkestone, and Berlin, that would be it! The view of Folkestone Over the years, the conference has evolved. Early editions had minimal evening programs apart from the speakers’ dinner, leaving evenings free to socialize or wander around town. More recently, extra events have been added, and while they’re optional, I always feel drawn to attend. Folkestone is small — you’ll run into people anyway, which helps strengthen the community feel. If you have some time, you can explore nature as well. I still have to figure out how to walk from Folkestone to Dover. Last time, I must have missed a path and ended up getting a lift near Samphire Beach from some kind locals people — before enjoying a well-earned pint while waiting for a delayed train. Walking from Folkestone to Dover Last time I also spent a few extra days at London to work a few days from the local Spotify office and meet some teammates. Meeting C++: Urban Energy in Berlin If you want to attend a C++ conference — the biggest one in Europe — and enjoy a vibrant city, Meeting C++ in Berlin is a clear winner. Berlin has a fascinating mix of history and modern life — from memorials of the national socialist and communist eras to thriving neighbourhoods full of cafés and cultural sites. The historical part of Berlin by night The conference itself didn’t have a dense evening program this year, and that’s fine. In a city like Berlin, it’s easy to connect with people outside official events. But given its size, it’s also easy to disappear if you prefer solitude. I had a great time meeting old and new friends, exploring districts like Boxhagener, trying local food and beer, and discovering places like the museum at the Kulturbrauerei and the slightly wild Volkspark Friedrichshain — a park that feels almost neglected but carries a quiet, sad history. Museum at the Kulturbrauerei In the end, I took no picture of Volkspark Friedrichshain. It’s the oldest public park in Berlin, opened in 1848. It feels highly neglected. Its biggest curiosity is its hills. After the second world war, the ruins of bombed-out buildings in Berlin were piled up into two articfical hills defining their landscape. It’s a good 10-minute walk from the conference venue or one stop with the tram. Comparing Formats: Program Density and Balance One recurring theme for me is the density of conference programs: CppCon packs every moment. If you want total immersion, that’s perfect. C++ On Sea and Meeting C++ offer more breathing room, though both have been experimenting with adding more evening activities. Personally, I’d vote for a middle ground: one evening program for a three-day conference, maybe something the night before. It helps build community without overloading people. CppCon’s format works because going out from the hotel is difficult anyway. For smaller conferences, giving attendees some unstructured time makes it easier to connect naturally. I know that there are several other great conferences out there which I’d love to attend, but I only want to write about ones I’ve been to, ones that I know. Conclusion Attending these conferences isn’t just about the talks — it’s about the people, the places, and the shared enthusiasm for C++. Each has its own strengths and personality, and I’m grateful for every experience. Oh, by the way, I’ve just published a new GitHub repository where I collect useful information about C++ conferences — things that often don’t make it into official FAQ pages. If you’re planning your next event, it might come in handy! Also, feel free to contribute.

Depending on who you ask, maybe it’s not a lot — I know some speakers do twice as many. But if you ask my family, you’d probably get a different (and understandable) answer. For me — for us — it’s a lot. It’s also an honour and a privilege in many ways.</p><p>To express my appreciation and gratitude toward the organizers and the community, I do two things:</p><ul><li>I try to prepare well for my talks.<li>I post <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/tags/tripreport/">trip reports</a> soon after each event — usually within a week.</ul><p>Those <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/tags/tripreport/">trip reports</a> are moderately personal: I share which talks I liked and also some of my impressions, but I try to make them useful rather than purely personal. Still, I think that once in a while, a more personal, less serious post has its place — and that’s what this one wanted to be originally.</p><p>At one of the social dinners at CppCon, a developer working for a FAANG company in New York asked me which conference I’d recommend. My answer: it depends on your goals — and your budget and constraints.</p><p>Yes, <strong>goals</strong>. Maybe you just want to listen to good talks — in that case, even online formats can work! Maybe you want to meet other developers — then online isn’t as great. Or perhaps you want to travel somewhere new and tick off a bucket list item while attending a C++ event. Don’t judge, that’s perfectly fine! Maybe you can use a conference as an excuse to visit another part of the world and then explore the region afterwards. Each conference offers a different balance of technical depth, community feel, and travel experience.</p><p><em>The conferences below are mentioned in alphabetical order. Also I only mention conferences which I’ve been to in 2025. There are many other great C++ conferences.</em></p><h2 id="cppcon-the-giant-of-the-scene">CppCon: The Giant of the Scene</h2><p>CppCon is the biggest event — in attendance, venue, and content volume. That can be a strength or a drawback. You can find a talk for almost every niche interest. Unsurprisingly, the schedule is dense, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. It also requires more time even if you are from the US. Most other conferences take 3 days. CppCon is scheduled for 5 days. That excludes workshop days.</p><p>It’s also quite a trip for those outside of North America. Traveling from Europe to Denver takes time and effort. Once you’re there, though, it’s immersive: talks sometimes start as early as 7:30 AM and often continue with sessions or social events past 9 PM. You’re there to make the most of it, and the atmosphere reflects that intensity.</p><p>Denver itself is a pleasant city, but not the kind you explore by hopping on a tram from your hotel. If you don’t have a car, expect to spend about two hours overall commuting to and from downtown. I managed to squeeze in two visits — once between my arrival and the opening reception, and again after the conference ended. Yes, it can be tiring, but I don’t travel to the other side of the world just to stay at a hotel.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/cppcon-denver.jpg" alt="Denver Downtown" /> <em>Denver Downtown</em></p><p>After CppCon, I was lucky to visit the Rockies with a new friend — we saw places I never imagined I’d reach. Driving through the mountains and visiting Bear Lake right before sunset were absolute highlights.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/cppcon-rockies.jpg" alt="View of the Rockies from the Trail Ridge Road" /> <em>View of the Rockies from the Trail Ridge Road</em></p><h2 id="c-on-sea-coastal-charm-and-community">C++ On Sea: Coastal Charm and Community</h2><p>Folkestone offers completely different vibes — a quiet coastal town with charming architecture, mild weather, and a walkable seafront. If I had to choose a place to live among Denver, Folkestone, and Berlin, that would be it!</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/folkestone-town.jpg" alt="The view of Folkestone" /> <em>The view of Folkestone</em></p><p>Over the years, the conference has evolved. Early editions had minimal evening programs apart from the speakers’ dinner, leaving evenings free to socialize or wander around town. More recently, extra events have been added, and while they’re optional, I always feel drawn to attend. Folkestone is small — you’ll run into people anyway, which helps strengthen the community feel.</p><p>If you have some time, you can explore nature as well. I still have to figure out how to walk from Folkestone to Dover. Last time, I must have missed a path and ended up getting a lift near Samphire Beach from some kind locals people — before enjoying a well-earned pint while waiting for a delayed train.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/cpponsea2025-folkestone-to-dover.jpg" alt="Me from Folkestone to Dover" /> <em>Walking from Folkestone to Dover</em></p><p>Last time I also spent a few extra days at London to work a few days from the local Spotify office and meet some teammates.</p><h2 id="meeting-c-urban-energy-in-berlin">Meeting C++: Urban Energy in Berlin</h2><p>If you want to attend a C++ conference — the biggest one in Europe — and enjoy a vibrant city, <strong>Meeting C++ in Berlin</strong> is a clear winner. Berlin has a fascinating mix of history and modern life — from memorials of the national socialist and communist eras to thriving neighbourhoods full of cafés and cultural sites.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/berlin-night.jpg" alt="The historical part of Berlin by night" /> <em>The historical part of Berlin by night</em></p><p>The conference itself didn’t have a dense evening program this year, and that’s fine. In a city like Berlin, it’s easy to connect with people outside official events. But given its size, it’s also easy to disappear if you prefer solitude. I had a great time meeting old and new friends, exploring districts like Boxhagener, trying local food and beer, and discovering places like the museum at the Kulturbrauerei and the slightly wild Volkspark Friedrichshain — a park that feels almost neglected but carries a quiet, sad history.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/berlin-kulturbrauerei.jpg" alt="Museum at the Kulturbrauerei" /> <em>Museum at the Kulturbrauerei</em></p><blockquote><p><em>In the end, I took no picture of Volkspark Friedrichshain. It’s the oldest public park in Berlin, opened in 1848. It feels highly neglected. Its biggest curiosity is its hills. After the second world war, the ruins of bombed-out buildings in Berlin were piled up into two articfical hills defining their landscape. It’s a good 10-minute walk from the conference venue or one stop with the tram.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="comparing-formats-program-density-and-balance">Comparing Formats: Program Density and Balance</h2><p>One recurring theme for me is the <strong>density</strong> of conference programs:</p><ul><li><strong>CppCon</strong> packs every moment. If you want total immersion, that’s perfect.<li><strong>C++ On Sea</strong> and <strong>Meeting C++</strong> offer more breathing room, though both have been experimenting with adding more evening activities.</ul><p>Personally, I’d vote for a middle ground: one evening program for a three-day conference, maybe something the night before. It helps build community without overloading people.</p><p>CppCon’s format works because going out from the hotel is difficult anyway. For smaller conferences, giving attendees some unstructured time makes it easier to connect naturally.</p><p>I know that there are several other great conferences out there which I’d love to attend, but I only want to write about ones I’ve been to, ones that I know.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Attending these conferences isn’t just about the talks — it’s about the people, the places, and the shared enthusiasm for C++. Each has its own strengths and personality, and I’m grateful for every experience.</p><p>Oh, by the way, <a href="https://github.com/sandordargo/cpp-conference-guide">I’ve just published a new GitHub repository where I collect useful information about C++ conferences</a> — things that often don’t make it into official FAQ pages. If you’re planning your next event, it might come in handy!
