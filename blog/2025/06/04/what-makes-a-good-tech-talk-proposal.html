I’ve already shared my path into conference speaking, and more recently, Andre Schau Knatten wrote about how to become a conference speaker. As the question has popped up a few times — especially around Meeting C++ Online — I want to dive into one specific part of the journey: how to write a talk proposal that stands out during the review process. Two Ways to Make Your Proposal Stand Out In my opinion, there are two main ways to get accepted to speak at conferences. 1. You’re Famous and Write a Recognizable Proposal This one also won’t help most of us, but it’s worth mentioning. If you’ve served on a program committee, you’ve probably seen those cryptic, one-liner proposals that get accepted anyway. Why? Because the submitters are big fish speakers. They’re great additions to the lineup. That said, I still believe they should take the time to write proper proposals. Respect the committee, folks. But if you’re reading this post, you probably don’t want to—or can’t—rely on fame. So let’s talk about the option that matters for most of us. 2. You Write a Strong Proposal This is your best bet. A solid, well-written proposal gives you the highest chance of getting in. Let’s be clear: deep knowledge of a topic is rarely enough. Speakers are usually good developers. But you might know in your immediate teams developers who are even better, yet they don’t get to speak at conferences. That’s okay. What sets speakers apart is not just what they know, but their willingness — and ability — to share it. Like a good merchant, you have to sell what you’ve got. You need to convince the program committee that your talk is worth one of their limited slots. Let’s look at what makes a strong proposal. Key Traits of a Strong Proposal A good proposal starts in your head. You need a clear idea of what you want to talk about. No, you don’t need a finished presentation when submitting. Not even a draft. But you should have a sense of the key points you want to make. Some conferences even ask for an outline — that’s basically the written form of your mental roadmap. Your topic should be appealing. A great presenter can make almost anything sound interesting, but tech conferences aren’t only about charisma — they’re about substance. That doesn’t mean your topic must be about the latest shiny feature. It just needs to address a real problem that many in the audience care about. And no, it doesn’t have to be relevant to everyone. Conferences attract a mix of experience levels—from students to seniors. That’s why “Back to Basics” talks are often appreciated, especially when they go deeper than textbooks or university lectures. Common Pitfalls to Avoid Too short? Don’t undersell yourself. If your proposal is vague or brief, reviewers won’t know what you’re offering. Worse, they might assume you didn’t take it seriously. Too broad? Equally dangerous. If your proposal tries to cover too much, it might signal that you haven’t clarified your main points — or that you won’t be able to cover everything in the allotted time. If you’re submitting for multiple lengths (e.g., 30 or 60 minutes), make that very clear. No value proposition? Remember: attendees — or their employers — are paying to be there. They want to learn something useful. Your proposal should tell them (and the reviewers) what value you’ll deliver. Why should someone attend your talk? Spell it out. And please — this should go without saying — don’t use your slot for product promotion or political agendas, unless you’re sponsoring the event and that’s the deal. How to Get Better at Writing Proposals Writing a compelling proposal isn’t rocket science — but it’s not instinctive either. Like most skills, it improves with practice. A passive (but still useful) way to improve is by reading past conference programs. While you won’t see full proposals, the talk titles and descriptions can already teach you a lot. Sometimes, when you submit a proposal, you’re invited to the first round of reviews. Some conferences even invite early bird ticket holders. Both options are great — but submitting a proposal is definitely cheaper! (Please don’t submit a dummy proposal just to review others. That’s disrespectful.) As a reviewer, you’ll gain access to full outlines and sometimes even to reviewer comments. Study what works. Take notes. Compare accepted talks against proposals. It’s an excellent learning opportunity—and a way to give back. Be Ready for Rejection No matter how good your proposal is, you will get rejected at some point. And that’s okay. When I tell my wife I was rejected from Conference X or Y, she starts to console me. But there’s no need. Rejection is part of the game. Organizers have limited slots — and you might need financial assistance too, which makes things even tighter. Even great proposals get rejected. Maybe your topic overlaps with a keynote. Maybe someone else submitted an even stronger take on the same subject. Or maybe the committee just needed more variety. It’s not personal. Sometimes (though not always), you’ll get feedback that helps you improve. That’s already a win. And without submitting, you wouldn’t have had the chance to learn — or join the review process. Conclusion Writing a standout proposal is part storytelling, part clarity, and part empathy for the audience. Know your topic, pick a fitting scope, and explain the value to attendees and organizers. Respect the process, keep refining your skills, and don’t be afraid of rejection. Because each submission, whether accepted or not, brings you closer to success.

You’re Famous and Write a Recognizable Proposal</h3><p>This one also won’t help most of us, but it’s worth mentioning. If you’ve served on a program committee, you’ve probably seen those cryptic, one-liner proposals that get accepted anyway. Why? Because the submitters are big fish speakers. They’re great additions to the lineup. That said, I still believe they should take the time to write proper proposals. Respect the committee, folks.</p><p>But if you’re reading this post, you probably don’t want to—or can’t—rely on fame. So let’s talk about the option that matters for most of us.</p><h3 id="2-you-write-a-strong-proposal">2. You Write a Strong Proposal</h3><p>This is your best bet. A solid, well-written proposal gives you the highest chance of getting in.</p><p>Let’s be clear: deep knowledge of a topic is rarely enough. Speakers are usually good developers. But you might know in your immediate teams developers who are even better, yet they don’t get to speak at conferences. That’s okay.</p><p>What sets speakers apart is not just what they know, but their willingness — and ability — to share it. Like a good merchant, you have to sell what you’ve got. You need to convince the program committee that your talk is worth one of their limited slots.</p><p>Let’s look at what makes a strong proposal.</p><h2 id="key-traits-of-a-strong-proposal">Key Traits of a Strong Proposal</h2><p>A good proposal starts in your head. You need a clear idea of what you want to talk about. No, you don’t need a finished presentation when submitting. Not even a draft. But you should have a sense of the key points you want to make. Some conferences even ask for an outline — that’s basically the written form of your mental roadmap.</p><p>Your topic should be appealing. A great presenter can make almost anything sound interesting, but tech conferences aren’t only about charisma — they’re about substance. That doesn’t mean your topic must be about the latest shiny feature. It just needs to address a real problem that many in the audience care about.</p><p>And no, it doesn’t have to be relevant to everyone. Conferences attract a mix of experience levels—from students to seniors. That’s why “Back to Basics” talks are often appreciated, especially when they go deeper than textbooks or university lectures.</p><h2 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2><p>Too short? Don’t undersell yourself. If your proposal is vague or brief, reviewers won’t know what you’re offering. Worse, they might assume you didn’t take it seriously.</p><p>Too broad? Equally dangerous. If your proposal tries to cover too much, it might signal that you haven’t clarified your main points — or that you won’t be able to cover everything in the allotted time. If you’re submitting for multiple lengths (e.g., 30 or 60 minutes), make that very clear.</p><p>No value proposition? Remember: attendees — or their employers — are paying to be there. They want to learn something useful. Your proposal should tell them (and the reviewers) what value you’ll deliver. Why should someone attend your talk? Spell it out.</p><p>And please — this should go without saying — don’t use your slot for product promotion or political agendas, unless you’re sponsoring the event and that’s the deal.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-better-at-writing-proposals">How to Get Better at Writing Proposals</h2><p>Writing a compelling proposal isn’t rocket science — but it’s not instinctive either. Like most skills, it improves with practice.</p><p>A passive (but still useful) way to improve is by reading past conference programs. While you won’t see full proposals, the talk titles and descriptions can already teach you a lot.</p><p>Sometimes, when you submit a proposal, you’re invited to the first round of reviews. Some conferences even invite early bird ticket holders. Both options are great — but submitting a proposal is definitely cheaper!<br /> (<em>Please don’t submit a dummy proposal just to review others. That’s disrespectful.</em>)</p><p>As a reviewer, you’ll gain access to full outlines and sometimes even to reviewer comments. Study what works. Take notes. Compare accepted talks against proposals. It’s an excellent learning opportunity—and a way to give back.</p><h2 id="be-ready-for-rejection">Be Ready for Rejection</h2><p>No matter how good your proposal is, you will get rejected at some point. And that’s okay.</p><p>When I tell my wife I was rejected from Conference X or Y, she starts to console me. But there’s no need. Rejection is part of the game. Organizers have limited slots — and you might need financial assistance too, which makes things even tighter.</p><p>Even great proposals get rejected. Maybe your topic overlaps with a keynote. Maybe someone else submitted an even stronger take on the same subject. Or maybe the committee just needed more variety.</p><p>It’s not personal.</p><p>Sometimes (though not always), you’ll get feedback that helps you improve. That’s already a win. And without submitting, you wouldn’t have had the chance to learn — or join the review process.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Writing a standout proposal is part storytelling, part clarity, and part empathy for the audience. Know your topic, pick a fitting scope, and explain the value to attendees and organizers. Respect the process, keep refining your skills, and don’t be afraid of rejection.</p><p>Because each submission, whether accepted or not, brings you closer to success.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a></ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/dev/'>dev</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/watercooler/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >watercooler</a> <a href="/tags/conference/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >conference</a> <a href="/tags/publicspeaking/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >publicspeaking</a> <a href="/tags/proposals/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >proposals</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a><div class="share-wrapper"> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What Makes a C++ Talk Stand Out in the Review Process?
