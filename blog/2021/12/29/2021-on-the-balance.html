Thinking about the gain is always positive, not like focusing on the gap.</p><h2 id="work">Work</h2><p>Let’s start with the work. Not because that’s the most important thing in life, but because after all, we talk mostly about software development on this blog.</p><h3 id="change-is-coming">Change is coming</h3><p>Probably the most important change is that I’m leaving my team after 4 eventful years, even though only next February. Yet, I find it important to mention it this year for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>I find it exciting<li>Despite the fact that move happens next year, the decisions were made this year</ul><p>After working on a car reservation system, I’ll focus solely on security-related services. I will work mostly but not solely with C++.</p><p>As I explained <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2021/12/08/top-7-reasons-to-change-a-team">here</a>, not only negative reasons can lead to a team change. Ideally, you change when you are in a comfortable position and you can choose the best fitting team.</p><p>I’m in an ideal situation right now.</p><h3 id="i-keep-working-from-home">I keep working from home</h3><p>I got into the pilot program of the full remote workers at my company. I come to the office once a month based on my agreement with my senior manager.</p><p>Otherwise, I work from home. Actually, I’m not sure if I could work as a digital nomad within France or I’m supposed to work from the same place within the country, but I don’t even care.</p><p>With the kids, I’m quite limited in terms of mobility and I enjoy a fixed routine and workplace.</p><p>I just prefer not working from the office.</p><p>It’s not all black and white. There are a couple of advantages of working from the office, one is that I walk more during the day, something I should probably change and the other is that there are some corridor discussions mostly about work that is useful.</p><p>Otherwise, I don’t find it difficult to keep in touch with colleagues even from home and I definitely prefer not to waste time in the traffic, to eat home with my wife and to be more around my kids in the morning and late afternoon.</p><p>A big test of full remote work is going to be next year when I’ll have to find my place at a new team. So far I can say that I would never ever choose another job that is not full remote.</p><h3 id="i-got-the-promotion-i-was-looking-for">I got the promotion I was looking for</h3><p>I really received everything I wanted from my work this year. I’m a remote worker now (have I mentioned that? :P), and more than that, I got promoted to become a principal engineer. That was a plan I told my management a few years ago and something I wanted to achieve before I turn 37.</p><p>During the early summer of 2020, I put a reminder for a year after in my calendar. It said that <em>you are ready to become a principal engineer</em>.</p><p>Five days later after the reminder went off, I got officially promoted.</p><p>In my upcoming book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/thesenioritytrap/">The Seniority Trap</a> I write about that you shouldn’t aim for status, but for growth, so what I said here might sound controversial.</p><p>What matters is what you see in a promotion. By the time I got there, I didn’t see the status. In fact, I still don’t always introduce myself as a principal engineer, I sometimes only say, I’m a developer.</p><p>There are two things that matter in the promotion:</p><ul><li>I do things I’ve wanted to do<li>I could sell them in a way that led to my recognition.</ul><p>And obviously, I’m not set now with the status. I don’t stop, I’d like to grow further. The promotion was only a key to opening more doors.</p><h2 id="work-outside-work">Work outside work</h2><p>Work outside work? What does that even mean?</p><p>I could claim that I do my hobby here and it would be true up to a certain level.</p><p>Writing, sharing knowledge, going to conferences are my hobbies, but it clearly reached the next level and it’s not just a hobby anymore. Given that I spent on writing and making presentations more than 10 hours of my free time a week, sometimes way above 15, it became a bit more and I hope to turn it into something that can sustain me later on.</p><h3 id="conferences">Conferences</h3><p>This year, I had the chance to speak at 6 different conferences, clearly a new personal record.</p><ul><li><a href="https://cppnow.org/">CppNow</a><li><a href="https://italiancpp.github.io/">The Italian C++ conference</a><li><a href="https://cpponsea.uk/">C++OnSea</a><li><a href="https://meetingcpp.com/2021/">MeetingC++</a><li><a href="https://cppp.fr/">CPPP</a><li><a href="http://www.telecom-valley.fr/stls2021/">Soirée du Test Logiciel (Evening of software testing)</a></ul><p>While most of these were online, and I didn’t physically travel a lot, they provided a great opportunity for me on many different levels.</p><ul><li>Presenting at a conference requires lots of preparation. It improves not just your knowledge, but your discipline too.<li>It helped me to learn from others too. Whenever I presented somewhere I got free admission and in most cases, my company provided me the free time to participate.<li>It also helped me to get to know some developers who I respect a lot<li>As on C++OnSea I delivered training as an instructor, I even made some money!</ul><h3 id="blog-growth">Blog growth</h3><p>It’s even difficult to recall the exact date and I’m lazy to look it up, but by now for about 3 and a half years, I’ve been posting every single Wednesday. Sometimes also on Saturdays.</p><p>This year, for the first time, I hit the 10k page views per month twice in a row.</p><p>It’s not huge growth, I already had some 7k months in 2020, but it’s a steady one.</p><h3 id="money-made">Money made</h3><p>This year, I published <a href="http://www.telecom-valley.fr/stls2021/">two e-books on Leanpub</a> and <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.dev/">a service</a> that I also converted into an e-book. Combining that with what I made as a trainer, I made my first 2k Euros which is not an enormous amount of money, but it’s a great start that I’m proud of!</p><p>I’m thinking about different ways to extend it. <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/secure-coding-practices-cpp-const">One of the is already turned into a course</a>, the second is supposed to be published in a few days. Besides, I’m almost done with another book and I’m ready to start another. These are not going to focus on C++, they are more generic books.</p><p>The one that is almost ready is <a href="https://leanpub.com/thesenioritytrap/">The Seniority Trap</a> that focuses on the road to becoming a senior engineer and all the different ways you can make or break your journey.</p><p>The second one will try to be a book that merges a novel with a technical book. Similarly how <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/the-phoenix-project-by-gene-kim/">Gene Kim did in The Unicorn Project</a> of <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/code-ahead/">Yegor Bugayenko in Code Ahead</a>.</p><h2 id="family">Family</h2><p>This is the most important. But probably not so much relevant in terms of this blog.</p><h3 id="the-kids">The kids</h3><p>My daughter moved to the big section of kindergarten and she’s getting better in French. She is also very brave and independent given her age. I remember when I was a little boy and I was supposed to sleep at my grandparents for the first time - who I loved and saw every other day -, they had to walk me home late in the evening.</p><p>We had no landline phone at that time, I imagine what a disappointment it must have been for my parents. My daughter slept over at her best friend already twice without any problem.</p><p>My son just started kindergarten and he is braver and braver. I’m really happy for him. I love that he tries new things, especially food. Even if he says <em>“no I don’t like it”</em>, trying new things is delightful.</p><p>I cook quite a lot and he spends lots of time with me in the kitchen. Who knows, maybe it will shape his career?</p><h3 id="are-we-still-passionate-travellers">Are we still passionate travellers?</h3><p>I guess it’s not surprising that we didn’t travel that much this year. Still, given the circumstances, we cannot complain. We continued discovering France, I think we really like the region between Arles and Narbonne, which we visited 3 times during the last few years.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/on_the_beach.jpg" alt="On the beach" /></p><p>We even managed to drive back to Hungary twice to visit the grandparents and last time we could even visit some parts of the country which were on our bucket list.</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="/assets/img/tokaj.jpg" alt="Tokaj" /></p><p>I wish we’d never have a worse year!</p><h2 id="how-to-continue-in-2022">How to continue in 2022?</h2><p>I talked more than enough about my past year, but what about the next one?</p><h3 id="work-1">Work</h3><p>Obviously, I’d like to finish a couple of things before I leave. Documenting some tools I wrote is the bare minimum. I’d like them to be used in the future too.</p><p>I would also like to leave one of our components in better shape. It’s one of the last ones with frequent core dumps and I’m on track to fix them.</p><p>I found a couple of classes holding resources but they don’t follow the rule of 5 which is the cause of some double deletes and I want to fix them and I also want to leave the impacted classes in a more testable way.</p><p>But all this is really just until the end of January.</p><h4 id="join-as-a-principal-engineer-and-make-an-impact">Join as a principal engineer and make an impact</h4><p>In February I’m going to join my new team. Four years ago I joined my current organization as a wannabe senior developer. The expectations were not so high and I easily went beyond.</p><p>Now, I’m going to join the new team as a principal engineer and I know that expectations are totally different.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not afraid. But I’m going to arrive prepared and with some plans to get up to speed quickly and help the team the best I can.</p><h4 id="joining-the-standardization-work">Joining the standardization work</h4><p>My company is one of the few French companies that are part of the C++ standardization committee and I have the chance to contribute to this work in 2022. I’d like to understand what goes on in the C++ ISO group and obviously, I’d like to contribute somehow.</p><p>Even though I have some smaller ideas, I don’t fully understand yet how to contribute. That’s to be figured out.</p><h3 id="work-outside-work-1">Work outside Work</h3><p>So how am I going to continue my work outside work? I will continue what I’ve been doing for more than 4 years, I’m continuing my blog posts on a weekly basis about C++ and more. What else do I plan?</p><h4 id="conferences-1">Conferences</h4><p>I plan to apply for conferences. That’s what is in my power, the rest we’ll see. Selection is not up to me.</p><p>I’m working already on my next talk on strongly typed containers for the <a href="https://twitter.com/mucplusplus">Munich C++ user group</a> that I will share around March.</p><h4 id="books">Books</h4><p>Last year I published <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/sandordargo">2 and a half books</a> (Daily C++ Interview was not meant to be a book) and I’m close to publishing my next one <a href="https://leanpub.com/thesenioritytrap/">The Seniority Trap</a>.</p><p>It’s something quite different from the previous ones, it’s not about C++, it’s about how I see the path to reach senior and staff engineer levels.</p><p>Excluding <a href="https://leanpub.com/thesenioritytrap/">The Seniority Trap</a>, I have plans for 3 books, but they are in a very early stage. One will be technical but for sure I won’t finish it before Q3 2023. The other two should follow the style of <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/the-phoenix-project-by-gene-kim/">The Phoenix Project</a>, a novel that incorporates engineering best practices and horror stories.</p><p>I loved <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/the-phoenix-project-by-gene-kim/">The Phoenix Project</a> so much that I also want to write books in a similar style. After all, we should write books that we’d want to read, shouldn’t we?!</p><h4 id="money">Money</h4><p>In 2021, I started to earn some money on the side. It’s too much to ignore it, but not enough to really make something out of it.</p><p>In 2022, I’d like to push it to the next level and make monthly 2000 Euros online. That would make a 10x jump compared to my last months.</p><p>If I can achieve and sustain it, I can start thinking about going part-time and spend more time on doing the <em>“work besides work.”</em></p><h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3><p>The software engineering and knowledge sharing part of my job is definitely part of my hobbies therefore what I do as <em>work besides work</em> is part of leisure activities.</p><p>Though that’s not all.
