This quest is motivated by a bug I discovered after a compiler update in a code base that I maintained. While I was looking for an answer to what happened, I realized that there are not only default and value initializations in C++ but many more different forms. Today, we are going to cover, default-, zero- and value-initialization. Default-initialization This is performed when an object is constructed with no initializer sequence. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; struct S { int m_num; std::string m_text; }; int main() { S s1; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;s1.m_num: &quot; &lt;&lt; s1.m_num &lt;&lt; &quot;, s1.m_text: &quot; &lt;&lt; s1.m_text &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; S* s2 = new S; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;s2-&gt;m_num: &quot; &lt;&lt; s2-&gt;m_num &lt;&lt; &quot;, s2-&gt;m_text: &quot; &lt;&lt; s2-&gt;m_text &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; } As you can see, the initializer can be omitted both for variables with automatic and even with dynamic storage duration, but it also works for static and thread-local variables. There is yet another possibility when a base class or a non-static data member is not mentioned in a constructor initializer list and that constructor is called. That might be a bit complex explanation, so let’s look at some examples. 1 2 3 4 struct S { S() {}; std::string m_text; }; In the above piece of code, a non-static data member (m_text) is not mentioned in a constructor initializer list. So when we construct an instance of S, m_text is default initialized. Now let’s cover the other possibility when the base class is not mentioned in the constructor initializer-list. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 struct Base { std::string m_base_text; }; struct Derived : Base { Derived() {}; int m_num; std::string m_text; }; For class types, default-initialization means that their default constructor would be invoked. For non-class types, the meaning of default-initialization depends on their storage duration. If their storage duration is automatic or dynamic, the value would be undefined. But if their storage duration is static or thread-local, then the variable gets zero-initialized. We’ll discuss what zero-initialization means just in a bit. It’s worth noting that references and const scalar objects cannot be default-initialized. The following types are scalar: arithmetic, enumeration, pointer and pointer-to-member types and all their cv-qualified versions, as well as std::nullptr_t. Value-initialization Now let’s talk about value-initialization! First of all, let’s see the syntax that would invoke it! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; struct S { S() : m_num{}, m_text() {} int m_num; std::string m_text; }; int main() { S s1{}; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;s1.m_num: &quot; &lt;&lt; s1.m_num &lt;&lt; &quot;, s1.m_text: &quot; &lt;&lt; s1.m_text &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; S* s2 = new S(); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;s2-&gt;m_num: &quot; &lt;&lt; s2-&gt;m_num &lt;&lt; &quot;, s2-&gt;m_text: &quot; &lt;&lt; s2-&gt;m_text &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;; } What we can see is that both local variables, s1 and s2 are now followed by an empty initializer sequence, either () or {} can invoke value-initialization. Value-initialization is also invoked for non-static members when they are initialized in the member initializer list with an empty pair of parentheses or braces. But what are the effects? As always, the answer is “it depends”. If it’s a class type and it has an implicitly defined or defaulted constructor, zero-initialization will happen. Unless the default constructor is non-trivial, then default-initialization will happen. If it’s a class type and there is no default constructor, or it’s user-provided or even deleted, then we are in the case of default initialization. If it’s an array type, then for each element we get into a recursive loop as they are value initialized. If it’s a non-class type, the object is zero-initialized. In all cases, if the empty pair of braces ({}) is used and T is an aggregate type, aggregate-initialization is performed instead of value-initialization. If T is a class type that has no default constructor but has a constructor taking std::initializer_list, list-initialization is performed just as we saw last week. Zero-intialization By now, we can clearly see that initialization is a complex topic in C++. If you’re not convinced, the next phrase will probably change that: zero-initialization does not have a dedicated syntax, but it might happen in certain situations. But first of all, what is zero-initialization? It depends on the type. If T is a union type then padding bits are initialized to zero bits and the first non-static named data member is zero-initialized. For arrays, each element is zero-initialized and for reference types, nothing is done. So far so good, but what does really happen? If T is a non-union class type, then padding bits are initialized to zero bits, all non-static members are zero-initialized, all non-virtual base class subobjects are zero-initialized just like each virtual base class subobjects, unless T is also a base class subobject itself. If T is scalar, then the object is initialized to the value obtained by explicitly converting the integer literal 0 to T. So bool b would be false, int i 0, double d 0.0 and a char c would contain the null character (\0). In the end, we are getting back to the fact that every type deep down is composed of built-in types and zero initialization will boil down to zero-initialize those. But when can it happen? For every named variable with static or thread-local storage duration that is not subject to constant initialization (another type of initialization!), before any other initialization. When an array of any character type is initialized with a string literal that is too short, the remainder of the array is zero-initialized. So the rest will contain \0 characters. As part of the value-initialization sequence for non-class types and for members of value-initialized class types that have no constructors, including value initialization of elements of aggregates for which no initializers are provided. This last one might need an example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 #include &lt;iostream&gt; struct S { int a, b, c; }; class C { public: int a, b, c; }; int main() { S a = S(); // the effect is same as: A a{}; or A a = {}; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;a = {&quot; &lt;&lt; a.a &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; a.b &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; a.c &lt;&lt; &quot;}\n&quot;; S b; // the effect is same as: A a{}; or A a = {}; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;b = {&quot; &lt;&lt; b.a &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; b.b &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; b.c &lt;&lt; &quot;}\n&quot;; C c; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;c = {&quot; &lt;&lt; c.a &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; c.b &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; c.c &lt;&lt; &quot;}\n&quot;; C d = C{}; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;d = {&quot; &lt;&lt; d.a &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; d.b &lt;&lt; &#39; &#39; &lt;&lt; d.c &lt;&lt; &quot;}\n&quot;; } /* a = {0 0 0} b = {-11906462 32551 1651076199} c = {32551 0 0} d = {0 0 0} */ We can see that neither S nor C has a constructor (only the default generated one). Yet, for a and d we see zero-initialization happening, while for b and c what we observe is undefined behaviour and some garbage values. The difference is that zero-initialization might happen as part of value initialization, which is clearly the case for a and d due to the usage of initializer sequences. On the other hand, for b and d, no initializer sequence is used and as such we are in the case of default-initialization which leaves the uninitialized members in an undefined state. Conclusion This week, we’ve discussed default-, value- and zero- initializations of objects. It’s important to keep in mind that relying on default-initialization might leave data in an undefined state but with zero/value initialization that will never happen. Next week, we’ll put the final pieces together and talk about constant and reference initialization.

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>We can see that neither <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code> nor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> has a constructor (only the default generated one). Yet, for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code> we see zero-initialization happening, while for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code> what we observe is undefined behaviour and some garbage values.</p><p>The difference is that zero-initialization might happen as part of value initialization, which is clearly the case for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code> due to the usage of initializer sequences. On the other hand, for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code>, no initializer sequence is used and as such we are in the case of default-initialization which leaves the uninitialized members in an undefined state.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This week, we’ve discussed default-, value- and zero- initializations of objects. It’s important to keep in mind that relying on default-initialization might leave data in an undefined state but with zero/value initialization that will never happen.</p><p>Next week, we’ll put the final pieces together and talk about constant and reference initialization.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/dev/'>dev</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/cpp/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >cpp</a> <a href="/tags/fundamental/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >fundamental</a> <a href="/tags/initialization/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >initialization</a> <a href="/tags/undefinedbehaviour/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >undefinedbehaviour</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a><div class="share-wrapper"> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=When and how variables are initialized?
