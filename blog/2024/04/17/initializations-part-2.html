This week, we continue this discovery with direct-, list- and aggregate-initialization. Direct-initalization Direct-initialization initializes an object from an explicit set of constructor arguments. Different syntaxes invoke direct initialization such as T object(&lt;at least one arg&gt;);, T(&lt;at least one arg&gt;); or new T(&lt;at least one arg&gt;); but it might also happen when you use curly braces (T object{oneArg};). Additional use cases are static casts, constructor initializer lists and values taken by value in lambda captures. While at first glance this might obvious there are some catches. Take this expression: T object{ arg };. In this case, object is directly initialized only if it’s a non-class type, otherwise, we talk about list-initialization. But if you use the parentheses syntax (T object(arg) then there is no such distinction between class and non-class types, in both cases, direct-initialization is performed. Also, T object{ arg1, arg2 }; would never be direct-initialized, that’s always an aggregate-initialization. In the expression [arg]() {}, the generated lambda members will not be copy-initialized, but they will be directly initialized. Another notable catch, or maybe better to say, a change introduced by C++17 is represented by the following snippet. Up until C++17, the following piece of code was ill-formed. 1 2 3 4 5 struct A { explicit A(int i = 0) {} }; A a[2](A(1)); But with C++20 it became valid and it initializes the first variable with A(1) and the second with A() - for elements without an initializer value-initialization is performed. With braces, it’s considered a list-initialization and it’s still invalid as it wouldn’t initialize all the array items. Direct initialization has quite a few small rules. What is worth noting is that since C++17 copy elision is guaranteed, there is no temporary object constructed when the initializer is a prvalue expression with the same type. The destination object is directly initialized. If the target is an aggregate class, it is initialized as it would happen with aggregate initialization except that it also accepts narrowing conversions and you cannot use designated initializers. Similarly to initializing an array, any elements without a value are value-initialized. For non-class types, all user-provided and standard conversion functions are examined and used if necessary. List-initialization First of all, list initialisation always involves braces. Not that we don’t have enough different kinds of initializations, we even have to separate two different kinds of list initializations. There is direct-list-initialization and copy-list-initialization. In general, we can talk about direct-list-initialization where there is no = between the object to be initialized and the opening brace (T object{arg1, arg2};) and copy-list-initialization when there is a = (T object = { arg1, arg2 };). Besides these cases, direct-list-initialization can happen when a possibly empty pair of braces follow T, new T or even member variables in the constructor-initializer-list. Further cases for copy-list-initialization involve also a possible empty pair of braces in function or constructor calls, return statements, subscript expressions ([{...}]) and the right side of assignments. There are a couple of different rules to consider if we want to understand what actually happens during a list-initialization. If T is an aggregate class, you don’t use designated initializers and there is one single parameter then either copy-initialization or direct-initialization will be performed depending on whether you’re in the case of copy-list-initialization or direct-list-initialization. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 struct Aggregate { int num; char c; }; int main() { Aggregate a{4, &#39;c&#39;}; // direct-list-initialization =&gt; direct-initialization Aggregate b = {4, &#39;c&#39;}; // copy-list-initialization =&gt; copy-initialization return 0; } Otherwise, if T is an aggregate type, aggregate-initialization is performed. If T is a char array and between the braces there is only a string literal the array will be initialization from the string literal. If the size of the array is not declared then the size of the literal + 1 for the \0 will be the size, otherwise, if the declared size is longer than the literal’s size + 1, the rest will be filled with \0 characters. If the literal is too long, the program is ill-formed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 int main() { char arr1[4] = {&quot;abc&quot;}; // &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;\0&#39; char arr2[5] = {&quot;abc&quot;}; // &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;\0&#39;, &#39;\0&#39; char arr3[] = {&quot;abc&quot;}; // arr3[4], &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;\0&#39; // char arr4[3] = {&quot;abc&quot;}; // initializer is too long return 0; } If T is a class type and the braces are empty and T has a default constructor or T is non-class type, then value-initialization will be performed. If T is a specialization of std::ininitializer_list, then the brace-initializer-list is considered a std::initializer_list and each element will be copy-initialized from the list. If T has a constructor that takes only a std::initializer_list or it’s the first argument with others that have default values, those are considered first. If not, all other constructors are considered. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; class MyClass { public: MyClass(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; l): m_v(l) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;MyClass::MyClass(std::initializer_list)\n&quot;; } MyClass(std::vector&lt;int&gt; l): m_v(l) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;MyClass::MyClass(std::vector)\n&quot;; } private: std::vector&lt;int&gt; m_v; }; int main() { MyClass mc1{}; MyClass mc2{1, 2, 3}; MyClass mc3 = {1, 2, 3}; MyClass mc4 = std::vector{1, 2, 3}; MyClass mc5 {std::vector{1, 2, 3}}; return 0; } /* MyClass::MyClass(std::initializer_list) MyClass::MyClass(std::initializer_list) MyClass::MyClass(std::initializer_list) MyClass::MyClass(std::vector) MyClass::MyClass(std::vector) */ If T is a non-class type and there is only one item between the braces then either copy-initialization or direct-initialization will be performed depending on whether you’re in the case of copy-list-initialization or direct-list-initialization. It’s worth noting that narrowing conversion cannot happen with list-initialization. Aggregate-initialization Aggregate-initialization was mentioned several times while we discussed list-initialization, so let’s continue with that. It was introduced by C++11 as a form of list-initialization. It can happen only when braces are used as an initializer sequence. Since C++20, it might also include designated initializers. But what is aggregate? First of all, it might be an array type. Or it can also be a class type that adheres to a couple of requirements. An aggregate class cannot have any of the following (as of C++20): user-declared or inherited constructors private or protected direct non-static data members virtual base classes private or protected direct base classes virtual member functions If you use aggregate initialization, array elements will be initialized in subscript order and for classes, direct base classes and non-static data members will be initialized in declaration order. It’s worth noting that it’s possible to nest initializer lists, to initialize both an object and its member. Even though in many situations, the braces around the nested initializer list can be omitted. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 struct Foo { int i; int j; int a[3]; }; struct Bar { int x; Foo b; }; int main() { // These are the same initializations Bar s1 = {1, {2, 3, {4, 5, 6}}}; Bar s2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; return 0; } When aggregate-initialisation is performed, you cannot pass more items than expected, it won’t compile. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 struct Foo { int i; int j; int a[3]; }; int main() { // error: too many initializers for &#39;Foo&#39; Foo f = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; return 0; } When aggregate initialization is performed of an object, on the items there will be either direct-, copy- or list-initialization performed. Conclusion After having discussed the importance of initializations two weeks ago and exploring the different initializer syntaxes and copy-initialization last week, we discussed 3 other kinds of initialization this week. We saw how direct initialization is used to initialize objets from its constructor arguments and then we deeped down into the world of brace initialization with list- and argument-initialization.

Different syntaxes invoke direct initialization such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T object(&lt;at least one arg&gt;);</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T(&lt;at least one arg&gt;);</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new T(&lt;at least one arg&gt;);</code> but it might also happen when you use curly braces (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T object{oneArg};</code>). Additional use cases are static casts, constructor initializer lists and values taken by value in lambda captures.</p><p>While at first glance this might obvious there are some catches.</p><p>Take this expression: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T object{ arg };</code>. In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">object</code> is directly initialized only if it’s a non-class type, otherwise, we talk about list-initialization. But if you use the parentheses syntax (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T object(arg)</code> then there is no such distinction between class and non-class types, in both cases, direct-initialization is performed. Also, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T object{ arg1, arg2 };</code> would never be direct-initialized, that’s always an aggregate-initialization.</p><p>In the expression <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[arg]() {}</code>, the generated lambda members will not be copy-initialized, but they will be directly initialized.</p><p>Another notable catch, or maybe better to say, a change introduced by C++17 is represented by the following snippet. Up until C++17, the following piece of code was ill-formed.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>But with C++20 it became valid and it initializes the first variable with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A(1)</code> and the second with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A()</code> - for elements without an initializer <em>value-initialization</em> is performed. With braces, it’s considered a list-initialization and it’s still invalid as it wouldn’t initialize all the array items.</p><p>Direct initialization has quite a few small rules. What is worth noting is that since C++17 copy elision is guaranteed, there is no temporary object constructed when the initializer is a <em>prvalue</em> expression with the same type. The destination object is directly initialized.</p><p>If the target is an aggregate class, it is initialized as it would happen with aggregate initialization except that it also accepts narrowing conversions and you cannot use designated initializers. Similarly to initializing an array, any elements without a value are value-initialized.</p><p>For non-class types, all user-provided and standard conversion functions are examined and used if necessary.</p><h2 id="list-initialization">List-initialization</h2><p>First of all, list initialisation always involves braces.</p><p>Not that we don’t have enough different kinds of initializations, we even have to separate two different kinds of list initializations. There is direct-list-initialization and copy-list-initialization.</p><p>In general, we can talk about direct-list-initialization where there is no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> between the object to be initialized and the opening brace (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T object{arg1, arg2}</code>;) and copy-list-initialization when there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T object = { arg1, arg2 }</code>;).</p><p>Besides these cases, direct-list-initialization can happen when a possibly empty pair of braces follow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new T</code> or even member variables in the constructor-initializer-list.</p><p>Further cases for copy-list-initialization involve also a possible empty pair of braces in function or constructor calls, return statements, subscript expressions (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[{...}]</code>) and the right side of assignments.</p><p>There are a couple of different rules to consider if we want to understand what actually happens during a list-initialization.</p><p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is an aggregate class, you don’t use designated initializers and there is one single parameter then either copy-initialization or direct-initialization will be performed depending on whether you’re in the case of copy-list-initialization or direct-list-initialization.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

It was introduced by C++11 as a form of list-initialization. It can happen only when braces are used as an initializer sequence. Since C++20, it might also include designated initializers.</p><p>But what is aggregate?</p><p>First of all, it might be an array type.</p><p>Or it can also be a class type that adheres to a couple of requirements. An aggregate class cannot have any of the following (as of C++20):</p><ul><li>user-declared or inherited constructors<li>private or protected direct non-static data members<li>virtual base classes<li>private or protected direct base classes<li>virtual member functions</ul><p>If you use aggregate initialization, array elements will be initialized in subscript order and for classes, direct base classes and non-static data members will be initialized in declaration order.</p><p>It’s worth noting that it’s possible to nest initializer lists, to initialize both an object and its member. Even though in many situations, the braces around the nested initializer list can be omitted.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
