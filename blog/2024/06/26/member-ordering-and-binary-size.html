The importance of member ordering! I remember learning at a performance tuning workshop that the order of member variables can significantly impact the memory layout and size of objects. Considering this factor, you can make your class more cache-friendly to increase runtime performance. This matters mostly when you plan to store a class in big numbers in a container. But what about binary sizes? Before that, let’s first discuss what padding means. Padding and alignment When it comes to the memory layout of data structures, padding refers to the extra bytes inserted between member variables of a data structure to satisfy alignment requirements. These requirements depend on your platform. On most systems, 4-byte integers must start at a memory address that is a multiple of 4. Similarly, 8-byte doubles have to start at addresses that are a multiple of 8. That’s what we call alignment. Padding is the extra space between the variables that helps satisfy the alignment requirements. Alignment is important for optimizing access speed. Let’s take the following example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 struct UnoptimalOrder { int i1; // 4 bytes double d1; // 8 bytes int i2; // 4 bytes }; static_assert(sizeof(UnoptimalOrder) == 24); The assertion is true. Even though we have two ints of 4 bytes and one double of 8 bytes, the size of UnoptimalOrder is not the sum. It’s not 16 bytes, but 24. The reason is what I explained just earlier: 8-byte doubles have to start at addresses that are a multiple of 8. Therefore i1 goes to address 0, then it’s followed by 4 bytes of padding so that d1 can be placed on an address that is the multiple of 8. At the end, i2 follows along and some padding so that the size of the whole struct is a multiple of 8. If it would contain types that are 4 bytes large at maximum, it could also be a multiple of 4 bytes. Order elements by size to reduce padding To potentially gain some space in terms of binary size, you have to reduce the size of padding bytes. The easiest and best rule of thumb to follow is to order the members by decreasing size. If we consider the above example, we should start with the biggest member of type double, followed by the two integers. As such we can eliminate all the padding and decrease the size to 16 bytes. Let’s also rename the class to OptimalOrder. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 struct OptimalOrder { double d1; // 8 bytes int i1; // 4 bytes int i2; // 4 bytes }; static_assert(sizeof(OptimalOrder) == 16); It won’t always reduce binary size If you remember back to the article on object initialization, we saw that often the compiler is smart enough to optimize things and simply use .zerofill to reserve a big enough space. Even if you create an array of 10k objects with static storage duration, the order will not change the size of your binary if everything is default initialized. On the other hand, if one of the members has a value other than (something implicitly convertible to) 0, ordering will matter. The below two examples are both compiled to a binary of 16,888 bytes on my machine. With good ordering: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 #include &lt;array&gt; class Example { public: double a;// = 4.2; // 8 bytes int b;// = 1; // 4 bytes float c; // 4 bytes char d; // 1 byte bool e; // 1 byte bool f; // 1 byte // Assuming typical alignment, &#39;a&#39; (8 bytes) should be first, // followed by &#39;b&#39; and &#39;c&#39; (both 4 bytes), and then &#39;d&#39; and &#39;e&#39; (1 byte each). }; std::array&lt;Example, 10&#39;000&gt; arr {}; static_assert(sizeof(Example) == 24); int main() { return 0; } With bad ordering: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 #include &lt;array&gt; struct Example { int b;//=1; // 4 bytes char d; // 1 byte float c; // 4 bytes bool e; // 1 byte double a;// = 4.2; // 8 bytes bool f; }; std::array&lt;Example, 10&#39;000&gt; arr{}; static_assert(sizeof(Example) == 32); int main() { return 0; } We can observe that the size of Example is 24 bytes in one case, but 32 in the other. Yet the binary size is the same. But as soon as we add some initial values to the members, for example, 1 to b and 4.2 to a, there is a significant size difference. With the good ordering, the size is 264k while with the bad ordering it’s 347k. That’s a big diff! But not as big as the difference between the version with 0 initial values and some others. Conclusion Today we discussed member ordering. We saw that in order to minimize padding, we should order members in a decreasing order of their size. At the same time, even an unoptimal ordering will not change the binary size, if you zero initialize members. So the best thing you can do for binary size is to use default values for members which are implicitly convertible to zero. The second best thing to do is pay attention to member ordering. But that’s something to pay attention to anyway for cache friendliness.

The importance of member ordering!</p><p>I remember learning at a performance tuning workshop that the order of member variables can significantly impact the memory layout and size of objects. Considering this factor, you can make your class more cache-friendly to increase runtime performance. This matters mostly when you plan to store a class in big numbers in a container.</p><p>But what about binary sizes?</p><p>Before that, let’s first discuss what padding means.</p><h2 id="padding-and-alignment">Padding and alignment</h2><p>When it comes to the memory layout of data structures, padding refers to the extra bytes inserted between member variables of a data structure to satisfy alignment requirements. These requirements depend on your platform.</p><p>On most systems, 4-byte integers must start at a memory address that is a multiple of 4. Similarly, 8-byte <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code>s have to start at addresses that are a multiple of 8. That’s what we call alignment.</p><p>Padding is the extra space between the variables that helps satisfy the alignment requirements. Alignment is important for optimizing access speed.</p><p>Let’s take the following example.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>The assertion is true. Even though we have two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>s of 4 bytes and one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code> of 8 bytes, the size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UnoptimalOrder</code> is not the sum. It’s not 16 bytes, but 24. The reason is what I explained just earlier: 8-byte <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code>s have to start at addresses that are a multiple of 8. Therefore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i1</code> goes to address 0, then it’s followed by 4 bytes of padding so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d1</code> can be placed on an address that is the multiple of 8. At the end, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i2</code> follows along and some padding so that the size of the whole struct is a multiple of 8.</p><p>If it would contain types that are 4 bytes large at maximum, it could also be a multiple of 4 bytes.</p><h2 id="order-elements-by-size-to-reduce-padding">Order elements by size to reduce padding</h2><p>To potentially gain some space in terms of binary size, you have to reduce the size of padding bytes.</p><p>The easiest and best rule of thumb to follow is to order the members by decreasing size. If we consider the above example, we should start with the biggest member of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code>, followed by the two integers.</p><p>As such we can eliminate all the padding and decrease the size to 16 bytes. Let’s also rename the class to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OptimalOrder</code>.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>We can observe that the size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example</code> is 24 bytes in one case, but 32 in the other. Yet the binary size is the same.</p><p>But as soon as we add some initial values to the members, for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.2</code> to a, there is a significant size difference. With the good ordering, the size is 264k while with the bad ordering it’s 347k.</p><p>That’s a big diff! But not as big as the difference between the version with 0 initial values and some others.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Today we discussed member ordering. We saw that in order to minimize padding, we should order members in a decreasing order of their size.</p><p>At the same time, even an unoptimal ordering will not change the binary size, if you zero initialize members. So the best thing you can do for binary size is to use default values for members which are implicitly convertible to zero. The second best thing to do is pay attention to member ordering. But that’s something to pay attention to anyway for cache friendliness.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left;
