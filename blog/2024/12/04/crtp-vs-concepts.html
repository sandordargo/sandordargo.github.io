Class tagging might mean different things in different contexts, or at least might be implemented in different ways. The end goal is to mark, in other words, tag classes or functions to be used in certain contexts, with certain algorithms. As you’ll see, in our case it’ll also be a tool to prevent duck typing. We are going to see an example implementation of a static interface with CRTP with a couple of different derived classes, then we’ll see the implementation without CRTP. The CRTP solution With the static interface, we are creating a static family of types. There is no need for dynamic polymorphism to share the same interface. It’s still granted through a base class, which is a template taking the deriving class as a parameter. Let’s use animals making sounds for a sample implementation. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 // CRTP version #include &lt;iostream&gt; template&lt;typename Derived&gt; class Animal { public: void make_sound() const { const Derived&amp; underlying = static_cast&lt;const Derived&amp;&gt;(*this); underlying.make_sound(); } }; class Cow: public Animal&lt;Cow&gt; { public: void make_sound() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;moo\n&quot;; } }; class Sheep: public Animal&lt;Sheep&gt; { public: void make_sound() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;baa\n&quot;; } }; class Dog: public Animal&lt;Dog&gt; { public: void make_sound() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;wouf\n&quot;; } }; template&lt;typename Derived&gt; void print(Animal&lt;Derived&gt; const&amp; animal) { animal.make_sound(); } int main() { Cow cow; print(cow); Sheep sheep; print(sheep); Dog dog; print(dog); } The non-CRTP solution In this case, we don’t use the CRTP pattern (the base class template) to add functionality but to ensure having a common interface without the costs of dynamic polymorphism. We can achieve that with a concept. 1 2 3 template&lt;typename T&gt; concept Animal = requires(T animal) { animal.make_sound();}; The problem with the above concept is that now every class that has a make_sound() method will be accepted as an animal. Even if the author of the Animal concept or the author of those fake animal classes didn’t want that. That’s why we are also going to require the AnimalTag. 1 2 3 4 5 6 class AnimalTag {}; template&lt;typename T&gt; concept Animal = requires(T animal) { animal.make_sound();} &amp;&amp; std::derived_from&lt;T, AnimalTag&gt;; We can be pretty sure that nobody will accidentally inherit from the AnimalTag Now let’s see the non-CRTP version. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 // non CRTP version #include &lt;concepts&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; class AnimalTag {}; template&lt;typename T&gt; concept Animal = requires(T animal) { animal.make_sound();} &amp;&amp; std::derived_from&lt;T, AnimalTag&gt;; void print(Animal auto const&amp; animal) { animal.make_sound(); } class Sheep: public AnimalTag { public: void make_sound() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;baa\n&quot;; } }; class Cow: public AnimalTag { public: void make_sound() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;moo\n&quot;; } }; class Dog: public AnimalTag { public: void make_sound() const { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;wouf\n&quot;; } }; int main() { Cow cow; print(cow); Sheep sheep; print(sheep); Dog dog; print(dog); } In comparison In my opinion, the non-CRTP solution is more readable and less error-prone. With the CRTP you might accidentally pass in a wrong template argument. It’s true that there is a solution to that. You can make the base class constructor private and make Derived a friend of Base. But you need to think about this. Also, for those who are not familiar with the pattern, seeing the CRTP inheritance plus the static_cast to the derived class is not necessarily easy to understand. The non-CRTP solution is more readable if you are familiar with concepts. While CRTP is a not-so-well-known design pattern, concepts are part of the main language, so you’ll have to get familiar with them sooner rather than later. If you want to learn more about concepts, you can find a series on this blog and I also have a book on concepts At the same time, you need to compile using C++20, which might not be available to you at the moment. I expected the non-CRTP solution to result in a significantly smaller binary, but I was proven wrong. With these small examples, I didn’t find a consistent difference. Depending on the optimization level even one was a bit smaller or the other. I still want to try it in a bigger example and I’ll report back the results, but it might take some time. Conclusion In this article, we covered how we can replace CRTP when we use it to have static interfaces for a family of classes. We saw that with C++20’s concepts, we could replace CRTP and have less error-prone and more readable code. The only question is whether you can already use C++20.

The end goal is to mark, in other words, tag classes or <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/27/tag-dispatching/">functions to be used in certain contexts, with certain algorithms</a>. As you’ll see, in our case it’ll also be a tool to prevent duck typing.</p></blockquote><p>We are going to see an example implementation of a static interface with CRTP with a couple of different derived classes, then we’ll see the implementation without CRTP.</p><h2 id="the-crtp-solution">The CRTP solution</h2><p>With the static interface, we are creating a static family of types. There is no need for dynamic polymorphism to share the same interface. It’s still granted through a base class, which is a template taking the deriving class as a parameter.</p><p>Let’s use animals making sounds for a sample implementation.</p><div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><h2 id="in-comparison">In comparison</h2><p>In my opinion, the non-CRTP solution is more readable and less error-prone. With the CRTP you might accidentally pass in a wrong template argument. It’s true that there is a solution to that. You can make the base class constructor private and make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Derived</code> a friend of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Base</code>. But you need to think about this.</p><p>Also, for those who are not familiar with the pattern, seeing the CRTP inheritance plus the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static_cast</code> to the derived class is not necessarily easy to understand.</p><p>The non-CRTP solution is more readable if you are familiar with concepts. While CRTP is a not-so-well-known design pattern, concepts are part of the main language, so you’ll have to get familiar with them sooner rather than later.</p><blockquote><p><em>If you want to learn more about concepts, you can find <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/tags/concepts/">a series on this blog</a> and I also have <a href="https://leanpub.com/cppconcepts">a book on concepts</a></em></p></blockquote><p>At the same time, you need to compile using C++20, which might not be available to you at the moment.</p><p>I expected the non-CRTP solution to result in a significantly smaller binary, but I was proven wrong. With these small examples, I didn’t find a consistent difference. Depending on the optimization level even one was a bit smaller or the other.</p><p>I still want to try it in a bigger example and I’ll report back the results, but it might take some time.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we covered how we can replace CRTP when we use it to have static interfaces for a family of classes. We saw that with C++20’s concepts, we could replace CRTP and have less error-prone and more readable code. The only question is whether you can already use C++20.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a></ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/dev/'>dev</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/cpp/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >cpp</a> <a href="/tags/crtp/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >crtp</a> <a href="/tags/concepts/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >concepts</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a><div class="share-wrapper"> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Replace CRTP with concepts?
