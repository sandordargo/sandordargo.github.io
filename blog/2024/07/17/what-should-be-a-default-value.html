What does it mean to have a default constructor? What happens if we don’t have one? Those are the questions we are going after in this article. A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments and initializes - hopefully - all the members with some default values. If you define no constructors at all, it’ll even be generated for you. Do we need default constructors? It really depends. Let’s first approach this question from a design point of view. Does it make sense to represent an object where the members are default initialized? If you represent a tachograph, it probably makes sense to have such a default state where all the counters are initialized to zero. The tachograph is the device that records driving times and rest periods as well as periods of other work and availability taken by the driver of a heavy vehicle. On the other hand, if you represent a person or a task identifier - which inspired me to write this article - it doesn’t. A person with an empty name or a task ID with an empty ID doesn’t make much sense. Well, that’s the case from a design point of view. What about the technical aspects? What happens if we don’t have a default constructor? You’ll have a harder time using some standard library types. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 #include &lt;map&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; class TaskID { public: TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const TaskID&amp;) const = default; void serialize(std::string &amp;out_buffer) const { out_buffer.resize(sizeof(TaskID)); memcpy(out_buffer.data(), reinterpret_cast&lt;const char *&gt;(this), sizeof(TaskID)); } private: std::string m_uuid; }; void foo(const TaskID&amp; taskID) { // ... taskID.serialize(); } int main() { std::vector&lt;TaskID&gt; tasks; // cannot compile, resize() needs a default constructor // tasks.resize(10); // this doesn&#39;t work as there is no default constructor // std::vector&lt;TaskID&gt; moreTasks(10); std::map&lt;TaskID, std::string&gt; tasksMap{ {TaskID{&quot;ab12&quot;}, &quot;dummy&quot;} }; tasksMap[TaskID{&quot;ab13&quot;}] = &quot;other dummy&quot;; std::map&lt;int, TaskID&gt; tasksMap242}; // cannot use operator[], needs default constructor for the value type // tasksMap2[4] = TaskID{&quot;ab13&quot;}; foo(tasksMap.at(42)); } Just to show you two examples, you’ll have difficulties to use std::vector or std::map up to their full extents. At the same time, these limitations are not necessarily blocking. On the other hand, there is another limitation that is harder to swallow. Let’s say that you have another class Widget that would hold TaskID by value. That’s possible, sure, but that class cannot have an auto-generated default constructor because it would require that TaskID has a default constructor. Let’s assume that at the moment of construction, we cannot have the meaningful value TaskID, because we only can or want to figure that out later. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 #include &lt;map&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; class TaskID { public: TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const TaskID&amp;) const = default; private: std::string m_uuid; }; class Widget { public: // ... TaskID getTaskID() const { return taskId; } private: TaskID taskId; }; void foo(const TaskID&amp; taskID) { // ... taskID.serialize(); } int main() { // error: call to implicitly-deleted default constructor of &#39;Widget&#39; Widget widget; foo(widget.getTaskID()); } We can still provide a default constructor for that Widget, but how would you instantiate a default TaskID? Or any class that doesn’t have a meaningful empty state? Still use a default constructor We could assign some dummy values for members. For integers, we can often see that -1 is used as a number to represent an invalid state. For strings that could be just an empty value. Let’s be honest, most often people don’t really think about these questions, they just let an object be created with the default values of the members. If they see that the code doesn’t compile, because the default constructor is missing for a class, they just add it. If they are more careful, they probably define a member function like isValid() to check the validity of an object. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 class TaskID { public: TaskID() = default; TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const TaskID&amp;) const = default; bool isValid() const { return !m_uuid.empty(); } private: std::string m_uuid; }; void foo(const TaskID&amp; taskID) { if (!taskID.isValid()) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } But what other options do we have if we care about not creating objects with meaningless default values? Wrap your object with std::optional To avoid having a default constructor, but still be able to use it as a class member or to use it with the different standard containers, we can wrap TaskID with std::optional. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 #include &lt;map&gt; #include &lt;optional&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; class TaskID { public: TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const TaskID&amp;) const = default; private: std::string m_uuid; }; void foo(std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (!taskID) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } int main() { std::vector&lt;std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt;&gt; tasks; tasks.resize(10); std::vector&lt;std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt;&gt; moreTasks(10); std::map&lt;TaskID, std::string&gt; tasksMap{ {TaskID{&quot;ab12&quot;}, &quot;dummy&quot;} }; tasksMap[TaskID{&quot;ab13&quot;}] = &quot;other dummy&quot;; std::map&lt;int, std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt;&gt; tasksMap242}; tasksMap2[4] = TaskID{&quot;ab13&quot;}; foo(tasksMap2[42]); } What does that mean for us? From a practical point of view, we have to validate if a TaskID is present to avoid segmentation faults or bad_optional_access. In other words, we have an extra layer. That can be cumbersome. From a semantic point of view, this means that a TaskID is either present or not. It’s optionally present. I’d argue that it’s only partially what we want to communicate. What we want to say in most cases is that the TaskID is not yet available or it’s already there. At the same time, std::optional’s communication capabilities stop here. Let’s look into another option with more communication capabilities. Use std::variant std::variant&lt;Ts...&gt; is a bit like std::optional&lt;T&gt; but on steroids. Instead of std::nullopt or T, it can hold practically any kind and number of different types. Therefore, instead of std::nullopt, we might say that it can hold a TaskID, InvalidTaskID, UninitialziedTaskID, etc. It’s enough to define those other options as empty structs. 1 2 3 4 5 class TaskID { /* as before*/ }; struct InvalidTaskID{}; struct UninitialziedTaskID {}; std::variant&lt;UninitialziedTaskID, InvalidTaskID, TaskID&gt; taskID; I put UninitialziedTaskID in the first place in the template argument list because by default variables will be initialized to that. Compared to std::optional its usage is not painfully complicated, though probably you’ll need to use quite a few std::holds_alternative&lt;T&gt; and std::get&lt;T&gt; in your code which can hinder its readability. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 void foo(std::variant&lt;UninitialziedTaskID, InvalidTaskID, TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (!std::holds_alternative&lt;TaskID&gt;(taskID)) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } void bar(std::variant&lt;UninitialziedTaskID, InvalidTaskID, TaskID&gt; taskID) { try { std::get&lt;TaskID&gt;(taskId).serialize() } catch (std::bad_variant_access const&amp; ex) { std::cout &lt;&lt; ex.what() &lt;&lt; &quot;: taskID didn&#39;t contain TaskID\n&quot;; } } Use std::variant combined with an enum There is an interesting option we haven’t experimented with yet. We could use std::variant with only two types, TaskID in the second place and an enum in the first place which can hold the different invalid states. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;variant&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; enum class InvalidTaskIDStates { InvalidTaskID, UninitialziedTaskID, }; class TaskID { public: TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; private: std::string m_uuid; }; void foo(std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (std::holds_alternative&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates&gt;(taskID)) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } void bar(std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (std::holds_alternative&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates&gt;(taskID)) { switch (std::get&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates&gt;(taskID)) { case InvalidTaskIDStates::InvalidTaskID: std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;InvalidTaskID\n&quot;; return; case InvalidTaskIDStates::UninitialziedTaskID: std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;UninitialziedTaskID\n&quot;; return; } } // ... taskID.serialize(); } int main() { std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt; myvar; std::vector&lt;std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt;&gt; tasks; tasks.resize(10); tasks.push_back(TaskID{&quot;ab12&quot;}); foo(tasks.back()); bar(tasks.front()); } On the positive side, we can say that if we are interested in invalid states, we only have one variant to check. On the other hand, if we are interested in which invalid state a variable holds, we’ll need to mix two kinds of grammar. We need to use the API of std::variant and the syntax related to enums as well. Conclusion Today, we discussed what options we have if we don’t want our type to have a default constructor because it doesn’t make sense. We’ve seen that even in those cases having a default constructor might make sense, initializing the object to a kind of an invalid state. Even though it’s really not a best practice. Types without a default constructor are sometimes hard to use with containers. Our options are also limited when we need to compose other types that are default constructible, but one of the members have no default constructor. In such cases, we can wrap these types into std::optional or std::variant based on our needs. Of course, we could use (smart) pointers as well, but that’s not an option we discussed, because dynamic memory allocation is clearly not something we need to solve the original problem.

Let’s assume that at the moment of construction, we cannot have the meaningful value TaskID, because we only can or want to figure that out later. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 #include &lt;map&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; class TaskID { public: TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const TaskID&amp;) const = default; private: std::string m_uuid; }; class Widget { public: // ... TaskID getTaskID() const { return taskId; } private: TaskID taskId; }; void foo(const TaskID&amp; taskID) { // ... taskID.serialize(); } int main() { // error: call to implicitly-deleted default constructor of &#39;Widget&#39; Widget widget; foo(widget.getTaskID()); } We can still provide a default constructor for that Widget, but how would you instantiate a default TaskID? Or any class that doesn’t have a meaningful empty state? Still use a default constructor We could assign some dummy values for members. For integers, we can often see that -1 is used as a number to represent an invalid state. For strings that could be just an empty value. Let’s be honest, most often people don’t really think about these questions, they just let an object be created with the default values of the members. If they see that the code doesn’t compile, because the default constructor is missing for a class, they just add it. If they are more careful, they probably define a member function like isValid() to check the validity of an object. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 class TaskID { public: TaskID() = default; TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const TaskID&amp;) const = default; bool isValid() const { return !m_uuid.empty(); } private: std::string m_uuid; }; void foo(const TaskID&amp; taskID) { if (!taskID.isValid()) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } But what other options do we have if we care about not creating objects with meaningless default values? Wrap your object with std::optional To avoid having a default constructor, but still be able to use it as a class member or to use it with the different standard containers, we can wrap TaskID with std::optional. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 #include &lt;map&gt; #include &lt;optional&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; class TaskID { public: TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const TaskID&amp;) const = default; private: std::string m_uuid; }; void foo(std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (!taskID) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } int main() { std::vector&lt;std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt;&gt; tasks; tasks.resize(10); std::vector&lt;std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt;&gt; moreTasks(10); std::map&lt;TaskID, std::string&gt; tasksMap{ {TaskID{&quot;ab12&quot;}, &quot;dummy&quot;} }; tasksMap[TaskID{&quot;ab13&quot;}] = &quot;other dummy&quot;; std::map&lt;int, std::optional&lt;TaskID&gt;&gt; tasksMap242}; tasksMap2[4] = TaskID{&quot;ab13&quot;}; foo(tasksMap2[42]); } What does that mean for us? From a practical point of view, we have to validate if a TaskID is present to avoid segmentation faults or bad_optional_access. In other words, we have an extra layer. That can be cumbersome. From a semantic point of view, this means that a TaskID is either present or not. It’s optionally present. I’d argue that it’s only partially what we want to communicate. What we want to say in most cases is that the TaskID is not yet available or it’s already there. At the same time, std::optional’s communication capabilities stop here. Let’s look into another option with more communication capabilities. Use std::variant std::variant&lt;Ts...&gt; is a bit like std::optional&lt;T&gt; but on steroids. Instead of std::nullopt or T, it can hold practically any kind and number of different types. Therefore, instead of std::nullopt, we might say that it can hold a TaskID, InvalidTaskID, UninitialziedTaskID, etc. It’s enough to define those other options as empty structs. 1 2 3 4 5 class TaskID { /* as before*/ }; struct InvalidTaskID{}; struct UninitialziedTaskID {}; std::variant&lt;UninitialziedTaskID, InvalidTaskID, TaskID&gt; taskID; I put UninitialziedTaskID in the first place in the template argument list because by default variables will be initialized to that. Compared to std::optional its usage is not painfully complicated, though probably you’ll need to use quite a few std::holds_alternative&lt;T&gt; and std::get&lt;T&gt; in your code which can hinder its readability. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 void foo(std::variant&lt;UninitialziedTaskID, InvalidTaskID, TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (!std::holds_alternative&lt;TaskID&gt;(taskID)) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } void bar(std::variant&lt;UninitialziedTaskID, InvalidTaskID, TaskID&gt; taskID) { try { std::get&lt;TaskID&gt;(taskId).serialize() } catch (std::bad_variant_access const&amp; ex) { std::cout &lt;&lt; ex.what() &lt;&lt; &quot;: taskID didn&#39;t contain TaskID\\n&quot;; } } Use std::variant combined with an enum There is an interesting option we haven’t experimented with yet. We could use std::variant with only two types, TaskID in the second place and an enum in the first place which can hold the different invalid states. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;variant&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; enum class InvalidTaskIDStates { InvalidTaskID, UninitialziedTaskID, }; class TaskID { public: TaskID(std::string uuid): m_uuid(uuid){}; private: std::string m_uuid; }; void foo(std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (std::holds_alternative&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates&gt;(taskID)) { return; } // ... taskID.serialize(); } void bar(std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt; taskID) { if (std::holds_alternative&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates&gt;(taskID)) { switch (std::get&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates&gt;(taskID)) { case InvalidTaskIDStates::InvalidTaskID: std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;InvalidTaskID\\n&quot;; return; case InvalidTaskIDStates::UninitialziedTaskID: std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;UninitialziedTaskID\\n&quot;; return; } } // ... taskID.serialize(); } int main() { std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt; myvar; std::vector&lt;std::variant&lt;InvalidTaskIDStates, TaskID&gt;&gt; tasks; tasks.resize(10); tasks.push_back(TaskID{&quot;ab12&quot;}); foo(tasks.back()); bar(tasks.front()); } On the positive side, we can say that if we are interested in invalid states, we only have one variant to check. On the other hand, if we are interested in which invalid state a variable holds, we’ll need to mix two kinds of grammar. We need to use the API of std::variant and the syntax related to enums as well. Conclusion Today, we discussed what options we have if we don’t want our type to have a default constructor because it doesn’t make sense. We’ve seen that even in those cases having a default constructor might make sense, initializing the object to a kind of an invalid state. Even though it’s really not a best practice. Types without a default constructor are sometimes hard to use with containers. Our options are also limited when we need to compose other types that are default constructible, but one of the members have no default constructor. In such cases, we can wrap these types into std::optional or std::variant based on our needs. Of course, we could use (smart) pointers as well, but that’s not an option we discussed, because dynamic memory allocation is clearly not something we need to solve the original problem.

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>On the positive side, we can say that if we are interested in invalid states, we only have one variant to check. On the other hand, if we are interested in which invalid state a variable holds, we’ll need to mix two kinds of grammar. We need to use the API of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::variant</code> and the syntax related to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum</code>s as well.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Today, we discussed what options we have if we don’t want our type to have a default constructor because it doesn’t make sense. We’ve seen that even in those cases having a default constructor might make sense, initializing the object to a kind of an invalid state. Even though it’s really not a best practice.</p><p>Types without a default constructor are sometimes hard to use with containers. Our options are also limited when we need to compose other types that are default constructible, but one of the members have no default constructor. In such cases, we can wrap these types into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::optional</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::variant</code> based on our needs.</p><p>Of course, we could use (smart) pointers as well, but that’s not an option we discussed, because dynamic memory allocation is clearly not something we need to solve the original problem.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,<li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</ul><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/dev/'>dev</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/cpp/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >cpp</a> <a href="/tags/builds/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >builds</a> <a href="/tags/dependencies/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >dependencies</a> <a href="/tags/architecture/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >architecture</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a><div class="share-wrapper"> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 0;"></a> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What to do if you don't want a default constructor?
