Yes, from now on my blog is accessible at [sandordargo.com](http://sandordargo.com).

Even if at one point I'll decide to leave Github pages, I won't have to change an address. I decided to make this move right in the beginning, inspired by the great book of [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) called [Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual](http://amzn.to/2wK0lLI).
