My blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To build it I learnt a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Jekyll framework itself. It's been a great experience. Although, I'm neither a web designer nor a front-end developer. It's not my speciality to build a sexy site from scratch. However, by now I learnt the listed technologies well enough so that I can pick a theme, understand how it works under the hood and customize it to match my needs.

A few weeks ago when I started to build the [Frugal Riviera Blog](http://frugalriviera.com/), I knew that I need something nice and that I don't have the time or will to build on my own. Looking at my eyes gazed upon [Type on Strap by Sylhare](https://github.com/Sylhare/Type-on-Strap). I liked the design and after some small changes, it started to work as I wanted.

Then first I migrated my [wife's blog](http://mummysherpa.com/) and the last weekend I finished mine as well. The most difficult part of my migration was to select pictures for the main pages. So it was easy thanks to [Sylhare](https://github.com/Sylhare).

And a big thanks to everyone who reads my blog!
