Let's continue with what is changing in C++23. This time, let's look at the three changes related to the `chrono` library. The first two are related to `std::format` and using locales, and the last one is about what requirements `time_point` imposes on a clock.

## DR: Fixing locale handling in chrono formatters

[P2372R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2372r3.html) is a fix of C++ based on the bug reported in [LWG-3547](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue3547). The problem is a bug in the specification of chrono formatters in the standard.

While `std::format` is locale-independent by default and gives you the possibility to change the locale via format specifiers, the new formatter specializations of C++20 for chrono types are localized by default and don't let you change the locale via format specifiers.

There are three problems with this approach:
- It goes against the design of `std::format` (and by the way the `fmt` implementation)
- As chrono formatters are automatically localized, you cannot avoid locales, if you want to do so, you have to automatically format date and time manually
- Some chrono formatters act as if they would provide a locale-independent specifier (`%S`) and a localized one as well (`%OS`) which is misleading.

So the original behaviour of `std::format` and `std::chrono` is the below:

```cpp
std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU"));
using sec = std::chrono::duration<double>;
std::string s_std = std::format("{:%S}", sec(4.2)); // s3 == "04,200" (localized)
auto s_std2 = std::format("{:L%S}", sec(4.2)); // throws format_error
std::string s_fmt = fmt::format("{:%S}", sec(4.2));  // s == "04.200" (not localized)
```

And the fixed one is:

```cpp
std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU"));
using sec = std::chrono::duration<double>;
auto s_std = std::format("{:%S}", sec(4.2)); // s == "04.200" (not localized)
auto s_std2 = std::format("{:L%S}", sec(4.2)); // s == "04,200" (localized)
std::string s_fmt = fmt::format("{:%S}", sec(4.2));  // s == "04.200" (not localized)
```

Notice that what was automatically localized, is not localized anymore and at the same time, you have the opportunity to manually localize chrono literals.

## Clarify the handling of encodings in localized formatting of chrono types

[P2419R2](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2419r2.html) is solving another problem with `std::format` and `std::chrono`. I already wrote about it in [C++23: Encoding related changes](https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2024/03/20/cpp23-encoding-related-changes), but I think it's worth mentioning here too.

While [P2372R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2372r3.html) solves the problem of whether `chrono` types should be localized or not, this proposal solves how to handle encodings, when `chrono` types have to be localized. 

Let's take the example from the paper.

```cpp
std::locale::global(std::locale("Russian.1251"));
auto s = std::format("День недели: {:L}", std::chrono::Monday);
```

The problem is that before the acceptance of this paper ([P2419R2](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2419r2.html)), the standard didn't specify what should happen if the literal encoding (in this case of `std::chrono::Monday`) is UTF-8 and it exists in the specified locale in a different encoding.

One option is to use the local encoding and the other is to use a UTF-8 encoding.

In this case, with the locale encoding of "Russian.1251", we'd use CP1251 which is not valid UTF-8. Mixing the results in *"День недели: \xcf\xed"*, where "\xcf\xed" is in *Russian.1251* and it's not valid UTF-8. This is also called a "Mojibake" and is undesirable.

> Mojibake (文字化け) is a term in Japanese that translates to "character transformation" or "character corruption" in English. It refers to the phenomenon where text that is encoded or decoded incorrectly results in a display of garbled or unreadable characters. Mojibake is often seen when there is a mismatch between the encoding used to store or transmit text and the encoding expected by the software or system trying to interpret that text. 

With the acceptance of [P2419R2](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2419r2.html), if the formatted text is in UTF-8 and the locale is among an implementation-defined set of locales, each replacement that depends on the locale is performed as if the replacement character sequence is converted to UTF-8.

## Relaxing requirements for `time_point<>::clock`

[P2212R2](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2212r2.html) recognizes the need of passing a non-*Cpp17Clock*-like clock to a `std::chrono::time_point`.

Let's answer two questions here! What is a `time_point` and what requirements does a *Cpp17Clock* have?

`std::chrono::time_point` is a class template that represents a point in time. It takes a clock and a duration as template parameters and it acts as if it stored the time interval passed since the start of the clock's epoch.

The requirements of a clock are [listed here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Clock). Basically, these requirements fix that a clock's API must have `Clock::rep`, `Clock::period`, `Clock::time_point` denoting types, must support `Clock::now()` member function and defines when `Clock::is_steady` should be true. `is_steady` should be true if there are two clocks with the same epoch and if the time returned by one is less or equal at one `time_point` then it should be less or equal at any `time_point`.

The authors of [P2212R2](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2212r2.html) explain a couple of cases when the original requirements are too strict.

- C++20 introduced a clock that is not really a clock, `local_t`. It's a pseudo-clock to indicate that the time point represents local time in a not-yet-specified time zone.
- Sometimes, you need a stateful clock that requires a non-static `now()` function.
- Sometimes, you need to represent "time of day" as a distinct time_point without having the date specified.

But what is changing?

The standard doesn't impose Cpp17Clock requirements or `local_t` on `time_point`. For threads on the other hand, now it explicitly says that template parameters with the name `Clock` should model those Cpp17Clock requirements instead of requiring simply `is_clock_v` to be true.

## Conclusion

In this article, we had a look at C++23 changes related to the `chrono` library. We saw how the `std::format` becomes more consistent in handling durations and different locales. We also saw that `time_point` is relaxing its requirements on a clock.
