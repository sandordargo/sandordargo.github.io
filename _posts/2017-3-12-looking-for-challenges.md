It does not seem to easy to find a project. I've been checking a lot during the last few days and starred some repositories. Mostly Java and Python ones. But that doesn't matter that much.

It seems that people often don't maintain the issues section properly. Quite frequently if I open up an issue it seems that some pull requests were already merged, but the issue's status is not updated. I'm not sure what these mean.

Probably I won't start contributing during the next few weeks as I'm leaving for long weeks of vacation soon. But at least I'll try to figure it out how to start.
