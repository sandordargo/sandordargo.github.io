I already mentioned that at CppCon one of my favourite talks was the one by Steve Downey on std::optional&amp;lt;T&amp;amp;&amp;gt;. He also mentioned that there are three different uses of references in C++. I was thinking whether it’s four and disucssed this the next day during the bre... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Trip report: Budapest C++ - Breaking &amp; Building C++</title><link href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/22/trip-report-budapest-cpp" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trip report: Budapest C++ - Breaking &amp; Building C++" /><published>2025-10-22T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2025-10-27T18:15:07+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/22/trip-report-budapest-cpp</id> <content src="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/22/trip-report-budapest-cpp" /> <author> <name>Sandor Dargo</name> </author> <category term="books" /> <summary> We often spend the French autumn school holidays back in our hometown, Budapest, Hungary — and this year, the timing worked out perfectly for me to attend an event of the Budapest C++ Meetup. I’d like to thank the organizers for putting together such a great evening by sharing a short report from the event. More than a hundred people registered, and the room quickly filled up with local develo... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How to Pick Which Conference Talks to Attend</title><link href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/15/how-to-choose-good-talks-to-go-to" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Pick Which Conference Talks to Attend" /><published>2025-10-15T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2025-10-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/15/how-to-choose-good-talks-to-go-to</id> <content src="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/15/how-to-choose-good-talks-to-go-to" /> <author> <name>Sandor Dargo</name> </author> <category term="dev" /> <summary> You might say that it’s already mid-October and the conference season is over. That’s far from true! Europe’s largest C++ conference is still ahead of us: Meeting C++. At CppCon, I ended up sharing a table with Victor Ciura, and we had a great chat about career paths in C++ across different industries — and, naturally, about conferences themselves. One thing I remember from our discussion in p... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>C++26: range support for std::optional</title><link href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/08/cpp26-range-support-for-std-optional" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="C++26: range support for std::optional" /><published>2025-10-08T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2025-10-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/08/cpp26-range-support-for-std-optional</id> <content src="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/08/cpp26-range-support-for-std-optional" /> <author> <name>Sandor Dargo</name> </author> <category term="dev" /> <summary> I learned about the new range API of std::optional from Steve Downey at CppCon 2025 during his talk about std::optional&amp;lt;T&amp;amp;&amp;gt;. To be honest, I found the idea quite strange at first. I wanted to dig deeper to understand the motivation and the implications. The first example I encountered was this: void doSomething(std::string const&amp;amp; data, std::optional&amp;lt;Logger&amp;a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>C++26: std::optional&amp;lt;T&amp;amp;&amp;gt;</title><link href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/01/cpp26-optional-of-reference" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="C++26: std::optional&amp;lt;T&amp;amp;&amp;gt;" /><published>2025-10-01T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2025-10-12T12:08:37+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/01/cpp26-optional-of-reference</id> <content src="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/01/cpp26-optional-of-reference" /> <author> <name>Sandor Dargo</name> </author> <category term="dev" /> <summary> If you’re a regular reader of my blog, you know I’ve been sharing what I learn about new C++ language and library features ever since C++20. You probably also read my CppCon 2025 Trip Report. And this post is where the two come together. At CppCon I attended a great talk by Steve Downey about std::optional&amp;lt;T&amp;amp;&amp;gt;. Steve is the father of optional references—he co-authored P2988R12 with P... </summary> </entry> </feed>
