Here’s the problem we talked about: There is a class controlling a piece of hardware to which several other hardware modules could be installed. To manage the available modules, we want to pass a mapping to this class where the map would contain hardware IDs and corresponding module names. A perfect fit for a map... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Time in C++: Closing Thoughts</title><link href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/02/04/clocks-part-10-conclusion" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Time in C++: Closing Thoughts" /><published>2026-02-04T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2026-02-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/02/04/clocks-part-10-conclusion</id> <content src="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/02/04/clocks-part-10-conclusion" /> <author> <name>Sandor Dargo</name> </author> <category term="dev" /> <summary> Time is time. We tend to think it’s simple to deal with it. But it’s more complex than it sounds. Both in programming and in real life. You want to measure how long something took, add a timestamp to a log entry, schedule a task for later, or display a date to a user in their local time. Each of these sounds straightforward — until clocks jump, time zones shift, or tests start failing randomly... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Time in C++: Once More About Testing</title><link href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/01/28/clocks-part-9-once-more-about-testing" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Time in C++: Once More About Testing" /><published>2026-01-28T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2026-01-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/01/28/clocks-part-9-once-more-about-testing</id> <content src="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/01/28/clocks-part-9-once-more-about-testing" /> <author> <name>Sandor Dargo</name> </author> <category term="dev" /> <summary> I planned to finish this series this week. But then I realized that there are still a couple of important things about testing that I haven’t written about yet. We already touched on the problem of testing when we discussed system_clock, but it definitely deserves a bit more attention. We said that as it’s not really possible to mock system_clock, it’s a good idea to wrap your clock and pass t... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Time in C++: C++20 Brought Us Time Zones</title><link href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/01/21/clocks-part-8-cpp20-timezones" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Time in C++: C++20 Brought Us Time Zones" /><published>2026-01-21T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2026-01-22T20:08:14+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/01/21/clocks-part-8-cpp20-timezones</id> <content src="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2026/01/21/clocks-part-8-cpp20-timezones" /> <author> <name>Sandor Dargo</name> </author> <category term="dev" /> <summary> In the earlier parts of this series, we explored the foundations of &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt;: durations, time points, clock selection, inter-clock conversions, and even custom clocks.

Today, we’ll shift gears a bit: what if the clock you need… doesn’t exist? C++ lets you build... </summary> </entry> </feed>
