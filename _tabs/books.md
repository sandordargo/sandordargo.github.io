I'm a software developer. A principal engineer. In these eleven chapters, I share with you different challenges, events, situations that I encountered during your my while you're working towards my goals seeking senior positions.

There is a fair chance that you'll face these patterns too. Maybe you already lived them through.

While nobody's career can serve as a concrete recipe for success - and in any case, you have to define first what success means to you -, you can and should take ideas from other people's life and implement them in your career.

In this book, you will read about many helpful ideas to work on and pitfalls to avoid. It'd be hard to pick three items but if I must, here they are:

- Define your own definition of success
- Don't be afraid and learn to ask
- Speak up for your team and for yourself

### [C++ Concepts: Validate your templates compile-time](https://leanpub.com/cppconcepts/)

In this book, you are going to discover one of the flagship features of C++20, concepts.

You will learn about:

- the motivations behind concepts
- the 4 ways to use them with functions
- the different ways to use them with classes
- what kind of concepts are shipped with the standard library
- how to write your own concepts from scratch
- some real-life examples

### [How to use const in C++: On the virtues of constness](https://leanpub.com/cppconst/)

![How to use const in C++ cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cpp-const-cover.jpg){:height="66%" width="66%"}

Constness is such an important idea that in certain languages entities are `const`, in other words, immutable by default. If you want to become a seasoned C++ developer, you must understand how you can use `const` correctly. In this book, you'll learn when and how to use it in the different contexts it might appear:

- `const` functions
- `const` local variables
- `const` member variables
- `const` return types
- `const` parameters

By reading this book you will learn how you will learn about different factors influencing the size of your C++ binaries:

- different ways of programming, including runtime polymorphism, templates, inlining, etc
- various compiler and linker settings
- the intersection of the above two, such as RTTI and exceptions

## Books I recommend

I consider reading as a primary necessity of humans, just like eating. I'd like to help you to choose the good reads easier.
