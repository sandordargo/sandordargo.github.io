I'm a software developer. A principal engineer. In these eleven chapters, I share with you different challenges, events, situations that I encountered during your my while you're working towards my goals seeking senior positions.

There is a fair chance that you'll face these patterns too. Maybe you already lived them through.

While nobody's career can serve as a concrete recipe for success - and in any case, you have to define first what success means to you -, you can and should take ideas from other people's life and implement them in your career.

[In this book](https://leanpub.com/thesenioritytrap/), you will read about many helpful ideas to work on and pitfalls to avoid. It'd be hard to pick three items but if I must, here they are:

- Define your own definition of success
- Don't be afraid and learn to ask
- Speak up for your team and for yourself
