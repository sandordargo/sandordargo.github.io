This book helps you prepare for your next C++ technical interview if you are looking for an entry- or intermediate level position.

The questions are mostly not about edge cases and brain teasers but they cover the realistic knowledge you'll need to get a developer position in the C++ world.

The idea is that you take one question a day, you try to figure it out it on your own and then you check the answer in the book, plus the references.

The book covers topics such as:

- `auto` and type deduction
- The different usages of `static`
- Polymorphism, inheritance and virtual functions
- Lambda functions
- How to use the const qualifier
- Some best practices in modern C++
- References, universal references, a bit of a mixture
- C++20
- Special function and the rules of how many
- The Standard Template Library
