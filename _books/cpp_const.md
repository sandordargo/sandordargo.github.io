Constness is such an important idea that in certain languages entities are `const`, in other words, immutable by default. If you want to become a seasoned C++ developer, you must understand how you can use `const` correctly. In this book, you'll learn when and how to use it in the different contexts it might appear:

- `const` functions
- `const` local variables
- `const` member variables
- `const` return types
- `const` parameters
