I"p<p>It does not seem to easy to find a project. I’ve been checking a lot during the last few days and starred some repositories. Mostly Java and Python ones. But that doesn’t matter that much.</p>

<p>It seems that people often don’t maintain the issues section properly. Quite frequently if I open up an issue it seems that some pull requests were already merged, but the issue’s status is not updated. I’m not sure what these mean.</p>

<p>Probably I won’t start contributing during the next few weeks as I’m leaving for long weeks of vacation soon. But at least I’ll try to figure it out how to start.</p>
