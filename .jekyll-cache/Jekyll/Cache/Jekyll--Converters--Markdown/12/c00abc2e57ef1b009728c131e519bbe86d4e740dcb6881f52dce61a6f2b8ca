<p>It is easy for me to find a job. Period. Wait, maybe not. Well, it depends. If I‚Äôm too inexperienced it‚Äôs not so easy, because so frequently even for junior developers should have a shitload of skills that they can mostly get if they have already worked. But they haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶</p>

<p>If I‚Äôm a more experienced developer, it‚Äôs difficult for another reason. I become picky about what and with whom I want to work. There are so many bad and/or ignorant developers, poor managers, project coordinators and it‚Äôs difficult to identify them from the outside. Maybe I have a lot of choices, but I‚Äôm not willing to work with just anyone. How to filter out those projects/people/company that‚Äôs another question.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt want to be so picky and I just accept anything. In that case, it was indeed easy to find a job. But if I chose not so cautiously, I might set back my career and make my future choices more difficult.</p>

<p>To find a good job, it‚Äôs not so easy, the recruiters are not out there just to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMbl1ntpIXQ">please me</a>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs ignore all the possible issues and problems we might face and accept that it‚Äôs true. But then it‚Äôs okay to tell a carpenter that it‚Äôs easy to for him to make some furniture ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs his job. It‚Äôs easy for the chef to cook. In the end, it‚Äôs his job, right? It‚Äôs easy for the lawyer to write a contract, what the heck! That‚Äôs her job, isn‚Äôt it?</p>

<p>I have not worked from home yet on a regular basis. And you know why? Because I don‚Äôt find it easier than coming to the office. I‚Äôd need space at home to set up an office. Space is a lot of money, especially in a big city or on the French Riviera - where I live. The home office setup itself also cost some, but maybe your company subsidizes it, or you decide to pay for it. Fine.</p>

<p>Do you have children at home? Is it easy to work with them? Maybe not so much more difficult than with constantly chatting adults who even bring their pets to the office ignoring those who are allergic to fur‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I understand the fury, envy and jealousy. But it‚Äôs no more than that. It‚Äôs easy to think about something that you don‚Äôt understand at all that it is easy. It‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs the most difficult job, but it‚Äôs not the easiest either. I won‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs stressing because it is not. No job is stressing. It depends all on you. It‚Äôs a matter of how you perceive things. (I do agree that some jobs can invoke stress easier in people who are more prone to it!)</p>

<p>Yeah, we do make a lot of money compared to some other professions. But we do less than others. Anyhow, it‚Äôs a matter of choice and dedication. I don‚Äôt come from a rich family or a fancy neighbourhood. Of course, there are a lot more coming from way more difficult circumstances. But I knew what I wanted to become and why. I didn‚Äôt become a developer only because of a stable and steady income, but that‚Äôs also part of the equation.</p>

<p>I was interested in a lot of other things. Geography, history, philosophy to name a few. But I understood that with professions based on some other interests I would have had worse chances to break out from the milieu I‚Äôm coming from. I can still read a lot about other topics I‚Äôm interested in while I don‚Äôt have to make my <a href="https://medium.com/@SandorDargo/i-will-never-forget-that-i-had-to-choose-between-ham-and-cheese-a6205556750f">children choose between ham and cheese</a>.</p>

<p>I think I‚Äôm the only responsible for my failures and I‚Äôm mostly - but not solely - responsible for my success. The way is never easy.</p>

<p>It is as easy as finding a job. Except that we should mention that hopping to another job too frequently is not considered a great thing, but staying for too much time also hurts your career. What to do? I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm more the loyal staying one so far. It‚Äôs not necessarily an easy choice, but it‚Äôs my choice, so I have nothing to complain about.</p>

<p>There is nothing black and white - except for the chess board maybe‚Ä¶ Being a developer brought me a lot of possibilities and a pleasant lifestyle, but it‚Äôs not all unicorns with rainbow dust. With more possibilities, more decisions and responsibility came and besides it‚Äôs me who is responsible for where I am. Either if I like it or not.</p>
