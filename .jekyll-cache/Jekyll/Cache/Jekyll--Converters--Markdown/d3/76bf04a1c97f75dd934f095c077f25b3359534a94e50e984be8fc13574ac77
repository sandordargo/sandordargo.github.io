I"Ì	<p>Because I am hungry!</p>

<p>And I donâ€™t mean Iâ€™m hungry for the great food my wife or I prepare the evening before, but I am hungry for knowledge and I have to find time to learn, to sharpen my saw.</p>

<p>I get back home by a bit after 6 PM usually when we have dinner altogether. Then we do the rest of the chores and then I spend some time talking with my wife and/or playing with my daughter.</p>

<p>Around half past eight we bath her together (~95% of the time). After this sometimes I have about twenty minutes on my own, but sometimes I still have to complete some chores. Then I put my daughter into her bed and stay next to her bed until she falls asleep.</p>

<p>I felt a bit stressed before, just standing there, but some time ago I realized how great that time is for self-reflection. Next to my daughter I can calm down (not that I am a nervous type) and think about what I did, what I should have done differently, what I am going to change.</p>

<p>Usually itâ€™s around quarter to ten by the time I got back to our room.</p>

<p>A bit more than hour for ourselves and to go to sleep as I try to go to bed around 11 PM so that I can comfortably wake up around 5:30 AM.</p>

<p>In this last hour usually I spend a bit of time on some common activities (looking for a flat and a nanny these days, but it can be planning our next vacation for example), sometimes I can spend a bit of time on my pet projects and I always try to dedicate the last half an hour to read. Something fictional or something about self-improvement. As my energy level is not at its peak itâ€™s better not to read something purely technical.</p>

<p>Considering the above activities I wouldnâ€™t have so much time to learn. So when do I learn?</p>

<p>In the morning I exercise a bit and based on a weekly schedule I read different technical books, write this blog and spend some time on my pet projects. And basically thatâ€™s what I do during lunch time as well, including listening to some podcasts or crash course videos to appease my appetite.</p>

<p>Once in a while I go to the canteen to eat with colleagues and I regularly attend coding dojos in lunchtime. But I try not to spend to much time at the canteen (or in the coffee rooms), because I feel I lose time from learning about what is out there.</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot. As our offices are in the middle of some forests when the heat is not so unbearable as these days I go out to the forest to have a walk and have lunch with a nice book.</p>
