I"§<p>If you have been reading my book reviews, you know that I like history. Recently I wrote about <a href="http://sandordargo.com/blog/2020/06/17/sapiens-by-harari">Sapiens</a> and I quoted Churchill - you know the guy who pretty much led the fight against Nazis - saying that â€œa nation that forgets its history has no futureâ€. John Kennedy went more broadly when he wrote â€œwithout history, we have no future.â€</p>
