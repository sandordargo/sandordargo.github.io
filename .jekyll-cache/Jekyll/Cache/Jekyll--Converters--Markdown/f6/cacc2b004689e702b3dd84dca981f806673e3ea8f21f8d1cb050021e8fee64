I"¶<p>There is an e-mail from the <a href="https://dailystoic.com/">Daily Stoic</a> I go back to read frequently. I try to go back to it every time someone irritates me - so quite frequently. In that mail there is a quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_de_Mello">Anthony de Mello</a>: â€œThe question to ask is not, â€˜Whatâ€™s wrong with this person?â€™ but â€˜What does this irritation tell me about myself?â€™â€</p>
